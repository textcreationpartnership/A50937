            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE ſmall City of <hi>London-Derry</hi> having been the laſt Year the <hi>Scene</hi> of ſo great and remarkable Actions, 'tis hop'd that an impartial Account of 'em will not be unacceptable to the publick. <hi>Gratitude</hi> to Almighty God obliges us to record ſo many ſignal Inſtances of his Power and Goodneſs in the preſervation of that People. And it is no more than <hi>Juſtice</hi> to thoſe who either loſt or eminently hazarded their Lives in that Cauſe, to tranſmit the Memory of thoſe Services by which they have ſo generouſly expreſs'd their Zeal for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and their affection to the preſent <hi>Government:</hi> 'Tis true indeed, an Account of the Siege has been publiſht ſeveral Months ago; and had there not been beſides ſeveral material Miſtakes in it, many Paſſages entirely omitted that were of great Importance to ſet thoſe Affairs in their true and native light; or had thoſe faults of that account been ſince fairly <hi>corrected</hi> inſtead of being <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi> it would have ſuperſeded my labour in preparing this Narrative for the publick view; in the writing whereof I am ſo far from being conſcious to my ſelf of being byaſs'd by any affection to a Party, that I have been ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in repreſenting ſome matters of fact with all the Advantage they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, leaſt they ſhould have that aſpect.</p>
            <p>I have in this Narrative of <hi>Derry</hi> inſerted the moſt material paſſages in other parts of <hi>Ulſter</hi> (except <hi>Inniskillin,</hi> of which a diſtinct Account has been given by another hand) and of <hi>Sligo,</hi> from the Memoirs of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality, and others that were Actors in 'em; A piece of Juſtice due to the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> in thoſe parts, who with ſo great expence of their Fortunes, and ſome of 'em with no leſs hazard of their Lives endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the preſervation of their Countrey: For by this Account the Reader may ſee, they did all that could be expected from them, and the chief Cauſes to which their ill ſucceſs muſt be aſcribed, were their too great confidence in Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi>'s Promiſes and Conduct, and their too early expectations of Relief from <hi>England.</hi> And the behaviour of thoſe of them that ſtayed in <hi>Derry,</hi> and made up almoſt the whole of that Garriſon, is ſufficient to put that reproach of Cowardiſe out of Countenance, which ſome (out of deſign
<pb facs="tcp:99417:3"/>to exclude them from being employed in the Reduction of <hi>Ireland</hi>) have been ſo induſtrious to load them with: I have added in the end his Majeſties Letters and Inſtructions, becauſe they ſo fully manifeſt his Royal Care and Concern for the preſervation, not only of <hi>Derry,</hi> but of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>In the Account of the Siege it ſelf, I have not only compared others <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries</hi> with what I was an eye-witneſs of, but for fuller ſatisfaction offered this part of the Narrative to be review'd by ſuch of the Officers of <hi>Derry</hi> as are now in Town; ſeveral of whom, as <hi>Collonel Crofton, Collonel Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, Lieutenant Collonel Blair, Captain Alexander Sanderſon,</hi> &amp;c. having heard it read in the preſence of Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Langford, Collonel Upton</hi> and ſeveral other Gentlemen, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired upon every material paragraph to object againſt any thing either miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented or omitted in the relation, freely profeſs'd their aſſent to it: and Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> was acquainted with the Deſign of publiſhing it ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left the Town.</p>
            <p>I foreſee indeed that ſome who are concern'd may be offended with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Paſſages that ſeem to reflect on ſome particular Perſons, eſpecially Coll. <hi>L—,</hi> Dr. <hi>W—,</hi> and M. G. <hi>K—;</hi> to which I need only ſay, That as I have mention'd nothing relating to 'em but Matters of Fact, that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of all the Demonſtration that can be reaſonably expected, ſo this <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> would have been palpably imperfect and defective without 'em. What is ſaid of Coll. <hi>L—,</hi> is no more than what was neceſſary to vindicate the Forces at <hi>Clady</hi> from the imputation of Cowardiſe, with which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to palliate his own Conduct, to give the true Reaſon why the chief Officers left the place, and to juſtifie the Multitude in caſting off his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, when they ſaw him reſolv'd on giving up the Town to K. <hi>James.</hi> I may alledge the ſame as to Dr. <hi>W—;</hi> it was neceſſary to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Articles againſt him, becauſe they occaſion'd that material Change in the Government by the eſtabliſhment of the Council of <hi>14.</hi> And the other Paſſages were no more than requiſite to diſabuſe the World that had been ſo groſly impoſed on in the ridiculous Attempts us'd to make not only a chief Governour in the Garriſon, but a mighty Hero of that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, not only in the Account publiſh'd in his own Name, but in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of others who wrote their Panegyricks upon him. I ſhall only produce one Inſtance of this kind out of the <hi>Obſervations</hi> printed on Mr. <hi>W—</hi>'s Account; for among other <hi>Links</hi> in the Author's <hi>Chain</hi> of <hi>Miracles</hi> (as he calls it) this is the ſixth: <hi>The unanimous Suffrage of the People in electing and conſtituting Mr.</hi> George Walker <hi>their Commander in chief, than whom they cou'd not have pitch'd on a Perſon more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly adapted to ſo capricious an Employment, being a Man of exquiſite Parts, having a neat dexterity in accommodating the humour of the Rabble, a diſcreet temper in moderating the diverſity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, a prudent Managery of the Common Proviſions, a vigilant Care in the Order of Guards, Watches and Exerciſe, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage in leading 'em on to the moſt dangerous Enterprizes.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99417:3"/>A very eloquent <hi>Paragraph,</hi> that gives us the true <hi>Idea</hi> of a compleat <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi> only the Author had done better to beſtow it on Dr. <hi>W—</hi> in ſome part of the World where he is not yet ſo well known; for if all the other <hi>links</hi> in his <hi>Chain</hi> of <hi>Miracles</hi> were like this, I am afraid that even in <hi>London</hi> as well as at <hi>Derry</hi> it wou'd be miſtaken for a ſmall <hi>Legend:</hi> For he does not ſeem ſo much in this <hi>Character</hi> to have conſidered what was true, as what wou'd repreſent his imaginary <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>General</hi> as <hi>great</hi> and <hi>extraordinary.</hi> But ſince Governour <hi>Baker</hi> has been thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly <hi>pilfer'd</hi> of ſeveral of his deſerved <hi>Plumes,</hi> and Dr. <hi>W— adorn'd</hi> with 'em, it was but common Juſtice to <hi>reſtore</hi> 'em to the right <hi>owner.</hi> For what M. G. <hi>K—</hi> did after the Siege, it could not be omitted without diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the juſt expectations of the Reader, to know what treatment the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of that deſerving People met with from him, eſpecially when ſo very different from his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s declared ſenſe of their Services: And the rather becauſe his Carriage ſince to the Gentry, and other Inhabitants of the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> has been but too agreeable to it. And I may juſtly add, that I have been ſo far from aggravating theſe matters beyond just bounds, that I have omitted ſeveral things relating to theſe three Gentlemen, that were not inconſiderable, becauſe not ſo neceſſary or pertinent to this Narrative.</p>
            <p>Leaſt any ſhou'd think there is on the other hand too much ſaid of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, who were active in the Siege, I ſhall ſo far prevent that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as to aſſure the Reader that as there is nothing mentioned concerning 'em, but what they really did, ſo ſeveral things have not been taken notice of, tho to their Advantage, becauſe leſs conſiderable than what is here related.</p>
            <p>One defect indeed I muſt acknowledge in this account, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſeveral eſpecially of the Inferior Officers and common Souldiers, did excellent Service, and ſhewed great Courage in the Sallies, whoſe Names and particular Actions it was impoſſible for me to recover. But what I could learn, that was moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, I have repreſented with all the Impartialty I could, having been rather ſparing than laviſh in the few Characters given of ſuch as were moſt uſeful.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid, thus much to Obviate any Cavils againſt the enſuing Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall conclude this Preface with a few Reflections on the Contents of it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. The firſt Attempts of</hi> Derry <hi>for it's own Preſervation, were very juſtifiable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were but too ſtrong grounds to ſuſpect a general Deſign of the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> againſt the <hi>Brittiſh Proteſtants,</hi> and particularly of the <hi>Ultogh's</hi> who had given the earlieſt Demonſtrations of their cruel Diſpoſition in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of <hi>41.</hi> and engraven it in the moſt bloody Characters; Of what ſort of Men the <hi>Earl of Antrim's</hi> Regiment (deſign'd to Garriſon there) was made up, the Narrative gives a ſhort but true Account. And as theſe Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their extraordinary danger, were the only Argument that induc't a few youths at firſt to ſhut the Gates, and the Graver Citizens ſoon after to concur with them for ther own Defence; So the Argument carries that weight and ſtrength with it, that will ſufficiently clear 'em from any Imputation of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty</hi> or <hi>Sedition,</hi> in the Judgment of all that are not Bigots for <hi>Unlimited Non-reſiſtance.</hi> To aſſert, that in theſe Circumſtances, they might not juſtly
<pb facs="tcp:99417:4"/>deny Entrance to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Souldiers, till they had remonſtrated their danger to the Government, is in effect to ſay, they ſhould have taken no meaſures to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their own imminent ruine, but ſuch as were ſure to come too late. And perhaps if thoſe Gentlemen that have ſo freely cenſur'd 'em, had been in their Caſe, their fears wou'd for once have brought 'em into their wits; For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever paſſion they ſeem to have for a Notion they have ſo long valued themſelves upon, as their <hi>Shibboleth;</hi> I do not ſee that they are more fond of <hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction</hi> than other Men, when themſelves are in any danger of it. For what they did afterwards in Proclaiming K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and conſequently in oppoſing King <hi>Jame's</hi> Army, the Example of <hi>England,</hi> and the dependance that <hi>Ireland</hi> has on it, ſets thoſe Actions above the need of any Apology for 'em.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. Tis not very eaſie to find a parallel Inſtance in Hiſtory, where ſo great Iſſues depended on the Defence or Surrender of ſo ſmall a place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had <hi>Derry</hi> been Surrendred, the whole Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely loſt, and particularly that brave people of <hi>Iniskillin</hi> (whoſe reſolute Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition did not a little Contribute to the Preſervation of <hi>Derry,</hi>) had been unavoidably expoſed as a Sacrifice to the Fury of the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> K. <hi>James</hi> might have pour'd ſo conſiderable a Force into <hi>Scotland,</hi> as wou'd not only have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyl'd that Kingdom, (for that was done by a few) but in all human probability either overrun it, or at leaſt turn'd it into a Field of Blood; And how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult a Task it would have been in thoſe Circumſtances to have ſecur'd the peace of <hi>England,</hi> where there were ſo many dangerous Symptoms of Diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection among too many, and a ſtrange ferment among all, is too eaſie to imagine. But the Defence of that place, as it obviated all theſe diſmal Evils, ſo it has in a great meaſure blaſted all the other deſigns of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Faction againſt <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and Facilitated the Reduction of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the very Flower of K. <hi>James's</hi> Army having <hi>Periſht,</hi> and the Courage of ſuch as Surviv'd <hi>Sunk</hi> before thoſe Walls.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3. And yet ſcarce ever did a People Defend ſo weak a Place with ſo invincible Reſolution, under greater Diſcouragements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces ſent for their Aſſiſtance upon Collonel <hi>Lundy's</hi> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the condition of the Town as deſperate, return'd, and all their principal Officers perceiving how Affairs were managed, came with them. After which Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> and his Council were only Sollicitors to make the beſt Terms they cou'd for themſelves: When their Authority was broke by the Threats of thoſe whom they call'd the <hi>Rabble,</hi> there was ſcarce a Man left of any conſiderable Reputation for Experience or Conduct in Military Affairs. They had too great reaſon given 'em to fear ſome Treacherous Friends within, as well as a powerful Enemy without their Gates. They could ſcarce reaſonably expect any aſſiſtance from <hi>England,</hi> when thoſe ſent before, had left the place as hopeleſs: The Ships that came afterwards under the Command of <hi>M. G. K.</hi> never made any Attempt to come up, when they had no Obſtacle but what the Caſtle of <hi>Culmore</hi> cou'd give them, and had all the Advantages of Wind and Tide to favour them. (Nor did they make any Eſſay, till the time we were reliev'd; notwithſtanding the frequent ſigns we made to them of our Diſtreſſed Condition:) And ſome
<pb facs="tcp:99417:4"/>weeks after their appearance in the Lough, moſt of them were gone out of our ſight, ſo that we had little hope of Relief by them. And yet tho Sickneſs and Famine then daily ſwept off great numbers (for 'tis thought no leſs than ten thouſand dyed during the Siege, beſides thoſe that dyed ſoon after,) we would not hear of Surrendring, while there was any poſſibility for the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Subſiſt.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4. The Conduct of Divine Providence, in the preſervation of that City deſerves our admiration, and thankful acknowledgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides what has been already ſuggeſted, or is more fully obſerved in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it ſelf, I may add, That thoſe few Youths ſhould firſt ſhut the Gates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Earl of <hi>Antrims</hi> Regiment, when not one perſon of Note in the Town durſt openly concur with them: That the Multitude ſhould obſtruct the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it when ſigned by Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> and his Council, after the principal Officers had left it, and reſolutely adventure on the defence of it, under ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great diſadvantages, looks like the effect of ſome extraordinary impulſe on their minds. To what can we aſcribe it, that in ſo many Sallies, we ſhould loſe ſo very few men, (not above <hi>80</hi> in all,) and kill ſo conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Enemy, many more of whom are alſo reckoned to have died of their Wounds than fell in the Field, and 'tis ſuppoſed betwixt <hi>8</hi> and <hi>9000</hi> in all periſht during the Siege: That ſo many Bombs thrown into the Town ſhould do no more miſchief, (nay ſome of them by tearing open the Ground, diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome concealed Proviſions, which put us on ſearching for more with good ſucceſs:) That ſo many thouſand Proteſtants, whom the Enemy had driven to the Walls, ſhould be ſo ſoon diſmiſt again, and the ſhot we made at them, while at a diſtance and unknown, only ſingle out their Enemies: To what can we attribute this, but the immediate care and protection of Heaven. And that when we were reduc't to ſuch deſperate Neceſſities, thoſe two Ships ſhould ſo boldly attempt, and ſo ſucceſsfully (even though the Wind failed them,) effect our releif after the Enemy had made the utmoſt preparation to oppoſe them, looks as if the Almighty choſe our extemity, and the very difficulties of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, to enhance the glory of his power in it. The <hi>French</hi> cruelty in dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo many of our Friends before the Town, confirmed inſtead of weakning our reſolution to maintain it: Thoſe many Proteſtants that at the beginning of the Siege left the City, and took protection, and even the great numbers that died the laſt ſix weeks of the Siege, made thoſe Proviſions laſt the longer, which had they failed ſooner, neceſſity would have forc't us to ſubmit to an enraged Enemy, whoſe Treaties we had ſo little ground to rely on, and from whom we could expect ſo little mercy after ſo obſtinate an oppoſition.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5. How diſingenuous, as well as fooliſh, have the attempts of ſome been, to engroſs the honour of thoſe Actions to a Party. Eſpecially when this was done with ſo groſs partiality, as to monopolize it to that party, which tho about equal</hi> to the other, in the number of Field Officers, yet was far exceeded by the other in the number of inferiour Officers, and could not (according to the exacteſt Computation we could make,) claim above one in <hi>15</hi> of the common Soldiers.

            <head>THE LATE Memorable Tranſactions OF THE CITY OF <hi>London-Derry,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THe noiſe of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi>'s intended deſcent into <hi>England</hi> in Autumn, 1688. and the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made in <hi>Holland</hi> for that purpoſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly alarm'd the late K. <hi>James:</hi> He to ſtrengthen himſelf the more effectually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this expected <hi>Invaſion,</hi> commanded over from <hi>Ireland</hi> ſeveral <hi>Regiments</hi> of the ſtanding Forces there, who were by that time ſo modell'd, that they conſiſted almoſt intirely of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, and on theſe he ſeem'd to rely as his ſureſt Friends; a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Miſtake in his Politiques, though all of a piece with thoſe other Meaſures which his own Inclinations as well as the great Zeal of his Prieſt-ridden Cabal ſuggeſted to him; for his Army here could not bear it, to ſee themſelves out-rivall'd by a Crew of <hi>Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues</hi> in their Prince's Favour, and he could not have brought any Gueſts into the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nation more unwelcome to it than <hi>Iriſh Cut-throats.</hi> To ſupply the room of theſe Regiments in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> then Lord Deputy, iſſued out <hi>Commiſſions</hi> for levying four New <hi>Regiments</hi> in the four <hi>Provinces</hi> of that Kingdom: Of that to be raiſed in <hi>Ulſter,</hi> the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Antrim</hi> (an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Papiſt in the North) was made <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel;</hi> which <hi>Regiment</hi> (as 'twas commonly reported) he was ordered to have compleat and ready about the 20th. of <hi>November</hi> then enſuing. The Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s Regiment of Foot (a well-diſciplin'd Battallion) was then Garriſon'd in and about <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and their Collonel, ſeveral of the Officers, and ſome of the Soldiers being <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the Inhabitants of that City look'd on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there as a great ſecurity to 'em, and dreaded the thoughts of their removal: But the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> either out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſecure himſelf the better at <hi>Dublin,</hi> or (as was ſaid) with an intent to ſend that Regiment over to <hi>England,</hi> ordered them to March up from <hi>Derry</hi> towards <hi>Dublin</hi> by the 23d. of <hi>November.</hi> It was expected the Lord of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Regiment would by that time be in a readineſs to ſucceed them, and Garriſon in their ſtead, but it fell out very happily, that they were not compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed, 'till above a fortnight after the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s left that City. Some aſcribe this delay, partly to a Report then current
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99417:6"/>among the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that the new levied Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were to be all tranſported for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to which few of them had any great ſtomach; (their Countrey-men having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made any lucky expeditions thither, and ſeldom returned back with a whole skin) and therefore they came in but ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: partly to the curioſity of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in appointing a ſtandard for the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their new levied Souldiers, who were to be all near ſix foot high; tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, out of deſign of having their Army the more uniform, and formidable for their bulk, whatever they were for their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
            <p>But whatever occaſioned that delay, it cannot but be own'd as a remarkable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that a vacancy ſo ſeldom known before, ſhould ſo ſtrangely happen there in this Juncture. The Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being gone, the care of the City was committed to <hi>John Buchanan</hi> Deputy Mayor to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Corporation, (a Perſon of no good Reputation in the Town) who mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell'd the Town Guards as he thought fit: But the News of this new Regiment of the E. of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s, being intended to quarter there, was very unwelcome to the Inhabitants. They had a certain Account that they were all of them intirely Papiſts, and many, both of the Officers and Souldiers, the offspring, or near Relations of thoſe who in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of 1641. had ſo deeply embrued their hands in <hi>Britiſh</hi> and Proteſtant blood: And they had too juſt reaſon to believe that theſe Rake-hells (who were the very ſcum of the Countrey) had the hereditary <hi>incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> as well as the <hi>Blood</hi> of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors running in their veins: And their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular averſion to this Regiment was heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by the apprehenſions which they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally had of ſome miſchievous Project hatching among the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts,</hi> againſt the whole Body of <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants.</hi> And theſe fears did not want very probable Grounds to ſupport them; ſome of which it will not be improper to ſuggeſt. Many of their Prieſts at their ordinary Maſſes had declared publickly to their People, <hi>That they had ſome great deſign in hand, which would highly concern them and all their Nation, whereof they ſhould have particular notice, as ſoon as it was convenient; that 'twas their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible duty at the Peril of their Salvation, to do whatever their Prieſts ſhould direct and enjoyn them, requiring 'em in the mean time to buy and furniſh themſelves with the best Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons they cou'd.</hi> And the ſtories of this kind told by ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves, gain'd the more Credit, when it was obſerv'd, that generally through the whole Kingdom, not only the <hi>Men,</hi> but the <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Boys</hi> too began to furniſh themſelves with <hi>skeanes,</hi> and <hi>half-pikes;</hi> it being the great buſineſs of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Smiths in the Countrey to make this ſort of Arms for them: Theſe were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards called Rapparee's, a ſort of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Vultures that follow their Armies to prey on the ſpoil. I ſhall not mention the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bold and threatning Diſcourſes that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dropt from many of 'em, eſpecially when good Liquor had a little warm'd their Blood, or upon occaſional quarrels: But I muſt not omit, that as ſeveral Conſultations of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergy were diſcovered, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the County of <hi>Donegal,</hi> not far from <hi>Derry,</hi> where the great Debates were ſaid to ariſe betwixt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Fryars,</hi> about the execution of ſome great Deſign; ſo a particular Sermon preach't by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Fryar</hi> in <hi>Derry</hi> it ſelf to the Popiſh part of the Garriſon in the open Market-houſe, <hi>October</hi> 1688. did not a little allarm the Proteſtants there, ſome of whom were out of curioſity his hearers. The main ſubject of his Diſcourſe was about <hi>Saul</hi>'s deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> where he ſhewed how dangerous it was to ſpare one of thoſe whom God had devoted to deſtruction, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſerted <hi>Saul,</hi> taken the Kingdom from him, and ruined both him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, for that very reaſon, as he certainly wou'd all that were guilty of the like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience: And that they were obliged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways (as then from <hi>Samuel</hi>) to take their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections from their <hi>Clergy</hi> as from <hi>God,</hi> and punctually obſerve the ſame at the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of their Souls.</p>
            <p>The Application was thought very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and obvious.</p>
            <p>Some of their Clergy alſo were obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to buy up <hi>Fire-Arms,</hi> and procured ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Chain-bridles</hi> to be made, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were accidentally found and ſeized by <hi>George Phillips,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> And thô the News of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi>'s landing in <hi>England, Nov.</hi> 5th. gave the Proteſtants a reviving Proſpect of the happy change of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99417:6"/>of that Kingdom: Yet it rather increas't their fears of their preſent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, becauſe they concluded, if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhould make any Attempt while <hi>England</hi> was in a Combuſtion, they cou'd expect little relief from thence. But that which made the deepeſt Impreſſion on 'em was a a Letter dropt at <hi>Cumber, Decemb.</hi> 3d, in the County of <hi>Down,</hi> where the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Mount-Alexander</hi> then reſided: The ſuperſcription thus —<hi>To my Lord, This deliver with haſt and care.</hi> The Letter was as follows.</p>

And accordingly the Copies of it thus ſpread thro the ſeveral parts of the Kingdom, (added to the ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions that the forementioned paſſages gave of ſuch a Deſign,) frighted a great number of Proteſtants out of it, eſpecially about <hi>Dublin,</hi> and other parts that were more entirely under the power of the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> The Memory of the miſeries of 41 was freſh, and they were loth to truſt themſelves in the ſame hands that ſeem'd to have now more <hi>power,</hi> and better <hi>pretence</hi> to act thoſe barbarities over again.

                  </gap>,</hi> on the 6th of <hi>Decem.</hi> on which Day a great part of the new <hi>Iriſh</hi> Regiment came to Quarter in that Village. Mr. <hi>Phillips</hi> late that Night ſent a Meſſenger to the City with what account he had heard of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned letter, and to acquaint them withal, what untoward Gueſts they were like to have the day following: There being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of 6 or 8 Companies (as they were called) of <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Highlanders</hi> above dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the number, beſides a huge number of Women, and Boys, and what is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Meſſenger came into the Town the next morning, being the 7th of <hi>Decem.</hi> about the ſame time that Alderman <hi>Tomkins</hi> communicated to the City the Copy of the Letter to the Lord <hi>Mount-Alexander.</hi> This morning early Mr. <hi>Phillips</hi> ſent another Meſſenger expreſſing his ſence of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from ſo ill a Crew, and adviſing 'em to take care of their own ſafety. The Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger alſo told 'em that he had left ſome of the formoſt Companies within two miles of the Town, the reſt being on their way: Theſe Circumſtances concurring, ſtruck a mighty Terror and Conſternation into the Proteſtant Inhabitants: Several Caballs are held in the ſtreets; all were perſwaded there was ſuch a deſign as the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Letter ſuggeſts, and they look'd on theſe new levied Men as the moſt likely Tools for the execution of it. Alderman <hi>Tomkins,</hi> who brought the Copy of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Letter, conſulted Mr. <hi>Gordon</hi> a Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99417:7"/>Miniſter what was expedient to be done, who not only adviſed to the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Gates, but wrote that day to ſeveral Neighbouring Pariſhes, to put themſelves into a Poſture for aſſiſting the City, if there ſhould be occaſion for it. There was ſome muttering among the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> about ſhutting the Gates, which Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Tomkins</hi> at firſt privately encouraged: But when he with Alderman <hi>Norman,</hi> and ſome others had conſulted the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and found him altogether averſe to it, they were unwilling to be concern'd: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed however divers of thoſe who made ſome Figure in the Town, wiſht the thing were done, yet none of them thought fit to be themſelves active in it: But in the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Caballs which ſeveral of the City Youth had, when they put it to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether they ſhould ſhut the Gates, moſt of them were inclined to it, ſo much the rather, becauſe Mr. <hi>Gordon</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and incited ſeveral of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. By this time about three Companies of the forementioned <hi>Regiment</hi> were come to the Water-ſide, with 2 Officers, a <hi>Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,</hi> and <hi>Enſign.</hi> The Officers leaving the men, ferryed over, and came to the <hi>Deputy Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> with their <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:</hi> One of the Sheriffs (Mr. <hi>Kennedy</hi>) ſuſpected the deſign of theſe Youths, and intending to quarter the Souldiers that night on the other ſide the Water, had given 'em a ſecret hint to be prepared next morning, if they intended to prevent their coming in. But whilſt they were about con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting their ſtrength, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Souldiers, having (as is ſuppoſed) ſome intimation of their deſign, made all the haſt they cou'd over, and came to the Landing-place, about 300 yards from <hi>Ferry-Gate.</hi> The Youth obſerving this, about 8 or 9 of 'em, (<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Campſie,</hi> Mr. <hi>Will.

From thence they went to ſecure the other 3 Gates, and having placed Guards at each of them, met in the Market: So happily did theſe reſolute Youths nick the very minute of their deſign, and upon ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly raſh and deſperate action, did the preſervation of that Important place out of the hands of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> depend. The greateſt events in the <hi>Chain</hi> of Providence being often ſo contrived by exquiſite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as to hang upon the ſlendereſt <hi>Links</hi> in it. This ſudden turn extreamly ſurpriz'd the Graver Citizens of the Town, who tho loth enough the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Souldiers ſhould enter in, yet dreaded the Conſequences of ſhutting 'em out: But the <hi>Deputy Mayor,</hi> the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> the 2 <hi>Iriſh Officers,</hi> with other <hi>Papists,</hi> and ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em, came to the Market-place, and both by Promiſes and by threats endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to prevail on the Mobile to deſiſt from ſo raſh an enterprize, but all in vain. They had in the mean time ſent ſome to ſecure the Magazine, which the Mobile perceiving ſent a party to ſeize it; one of whom (viz. <hi>Mr. Campſie,</hi>) being ſhot by the Centinel, one <hi>Linegar,</hi> a reputed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, <hi>Linegar</hi> was ſeized and ſent to Gaol, and the noiſe of <hi>Campſie</hi>'s being wounded encreaſed both the Number and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Mob. In the mean time the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Derry,</hi> with others came to the Market-place, and made a ſpeech to the multitude to diſſuade them from ſo inconſiderate an undertaking, wherein he repreſented to them both the <hi>danger</hi> of it to themſelves, and the <hi>unwarrantableneſs</hi> of it, as it was a Diſobedience to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign: But the dangers they ſaw at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent made greater impreſſion on 'em than any fear'd for the future: And their dull heads could not comprehend how it could be ſo great a Crime to ſhut the Gates againſt thoſe whom they believ'd ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to cut their throats; and they were too much concerned to make good what they had now done, to hear any long harangues about it: The Deputy <hi>Mayor</hi> alſo attempted once more to diſſwade them, but to no purpoſe.

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who having received a full account of what was done, and their inducements thereunto, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared openly his Approbation of it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending their Courage, and aſſuring them of his utmoſt aſſiſtance; and thereupon went round the Walls, and to the Gates, encouraging their Guards and Centinels, and returned to the main Guard again, to ſhew his concurrence with them: He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured alſo to poſſeſs others of Note in the Town, with a juſt ſence of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of taking this courſe to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at that dangerous juncture, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral began to appear more openly in the matter, as entertaining the ſame apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſo as that Night he, Mr. <hi>Norman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jemmet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Moncreiff,</hi> Mr. <hi>James Lennox,</hi> and ſeveral others, being come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Guard-houſe, upon ſome diſcourſe there of their inability to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without conſiderable Aſſiſtance, wrote to ſeveral Gentlemen in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to acquaint 'em with what was done, to repreſent their common hazard, and the neceſſity of their Concurrence for their common Defence and Safety: To which Letters they received various Returns, ſome approving the Action, and promiſing their Aſſiſtance: Others diſcouraging what they thought ſo bold an enterprize.

            <p>About the ſame time, the principal Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Inniskillin</hi> wrote a Letter to the ſame purpoſe to their Friends at <hi>Derry:</hi> (Which ſee at the end.) Others in the Town wrote to the Government to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and lay the blame on the Mobile. I ſhould add here, that the <hi>Potent</hi> being more narrowly inſpected, was found de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; for 'twas in the body of it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Quarters for the Captains hereafter named, and their men, whereas there was no Capt. named at all.</p>
            <p>And thus ended this remarkable 7th. of <hi>December.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good Guards are kept within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Walls that night. And the next day, the 8th. of <hi>December,</hi> ſince they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both Arms and Ammunition, they broke open the Magazine, and took out thence about 150 Muſquets, with ſome quantity of Match, and one Barrel of Powder, and Bullets proportionable. There was in the Magazine at that time but about 8 or 9 Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Powder in all, and about 2 more in the Town; (2 or 3 of thoſe in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine were not fit for uſe.) There were but few Arms fixt, and thoſe deſign'd for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Regiment, the reſt being about a thouſand more were much out of order. The Biſhop that day left the Town, and went to <hi>Rapho:</hi> But the ſight of ſeveral from the neighbouring Parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whom the fear of an intended Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre drove thither for ſecurity; the rumour of a deſign among the Papiſts in Town to fire the City; and the rude Carriage of ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Souldiers in their quarters over the Water, drew many more of the Town to joyn with the Mob, for their common Preſervation. And yet I muſt add, that when towards the better ſetling of their Guards, they took an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99417:8"/>of all within the Walls able to bear Arms, they did not in all amount to 300, ſo depopulated was the Town at that time; the Suburbs were not numbred, but it was believed they could not make near ſo many more. This day the City was clear'd of the greateſt part of the Papiſts in it, and a Convent of Dominican Fryars pack'd off. The Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi> lodg'd that Night at <hi>Newton Limavady,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> whom he carried with him next day in his Coach towards <hi>Derry,</hi> (being the 9th. the fatal day for the expected Maſſacre.) The Poſt-Letters that Morning brought the News of the Prince of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s, &amp;c. going over to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> which gave us no ſmall encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and Alderman <hi>Tomkins,</hi> by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Mr. <hi>Gordon</hi>'s influence on his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſent in a conſiderable number into Town, under the Command of young Mr. <hi>Tomkins,</hi> as their Captain. For joy of their good News from <hi>England,</hi> the Gunner was order'd to diſcharge two of their beſt Guns, which he accordingly did; this put the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Souldiers on the other ſide of the Water into no ſmall Conſternation; about the ſame time one <hi>George Cook,</hi> a Butcher, drew up 50 or 60 Boys on the ſhore at the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rry-Key,</hi> whom the <hi>Iriſh</hi> took for <hi>Laganeers,</hi> (famous for the Victories they obtained over the Rebels in 1641.) ſoon after Mr. <hi>Tomkins</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gordon</hi> appear on a Hill near 'em with about 30 or 40 Horſe, having no deſign of diſturbing 'em. But all theſe Circumſtances ſo unluckily concurring to heighten their fears of ſome ſuddain deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction coming on 'em, put 'em on ſo haſty a flight, that many of their Officers left their Boots, and Soldiers their Coats behind them: Their Collonel, the Earl of <hi>Antrim,</hi> accompanied by Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> met 'em about a Mile off the Town, and having heard from his men a very frightful ſtory, thought fit to ſend Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> into Town before him, to bring him word whether they wou'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf, and who commanded the Town? Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> as coming from the Enemy was with ſome difficulty admitted, under a Guard, but finding he was no way diſaffected to the Deſign, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to joyn with 'em in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the Guard was taken off; yet upon his deſire to Mr. <hi>Cairns,</hi> who then command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Town, that ſome colour of force might be put upon him in what he did, he was publickly threatned with Confinement if he did not concurr with 'em: He was permitted to acquaint the <hi>Earl</hi> with his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing detain'd there, whom in his Letter he diſcouraged from coming thither; upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt thereof the <hi>Earl</hi> went back to <hi>Colerain,</hi> where he endeavour'd to rally his ſcatter'd Regiment. And the City conſidering their own Circumſtances, to encourage the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in the Country, whoſe aid they expected, and to engage Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> the more to their Intereſt, with Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi> his concurrence, beſtowed on him the Title of their <hi>Governour,</hi> which he accepted.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it was thought expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to write up to the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> then at <hi>Dublin,</hi> (in whoſe friendſhip they had great Confidence) ſome account of what had paſt, that he might interpoſe with the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> on their behalf, and do his utmoſt to allay his reſentments; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they ſent his Lordſhip a Letter, (which becauſe it confirms the foregoing Relation, I have annexed at the end) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that he wou'd communicate it to the Lord Deputy.</p>
            <p>On the 10th. Captain <hi>Forward,</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Stewart</hi> brought about 2 or 300 Horſe into the City, and Mr. <hi>John Cowan</hi> of <hi>St. Johns Town</hi> a Company of Foot, which they offer'd to our Service. But finding the need not only of more Men, but chiefly of Arms and Ammunition, the City unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly choſe <hi>David Cairns,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to ſend over as their <hi>Agent</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> giving him a large Letter of <hi>Credence,</hi> and full <hi>Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> under the hands and ſeals of the chief then in Town. He had with him alſo a Letter to the Society in <hi>London,</hi> which I have in the end inſerted; a private Key was alſo contrived to hold Correſpondence with 'em.</p>

               <hi>December</hi> the 11th. Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi> went for <hi>London</hi> The ſame day Governour <hi>Philips</hi> went to <hi>Newtown,</hi> and in a few dayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with about 3 or 400 Horſe: <hi>William Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Moyagh</hi> brought near 200 more, which they tendered to our ſervice.</p>
            <p>Soon after Letters from <hi>Dublin</hi> inform us that the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> had ordered the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> and Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> with ſix Companys of their Regiment to come down and reduce this City to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Obedience: But our Friends there cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd us againſt the receiving of 'em, and the City was generally averſe to it, and yet that their actions might not be miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, they endeavoured to repreſent the reaſons of 'em in a Declaration, which they Publiſhed about this time. — See in the end.</p>
            <p>When the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> came to <hi>Omagh,</hi> he ſent Captain <hi>Mac-Cauſtand</hi> with a Meſſage to this City, deſiring two or three of their Number to meet him at <hi>Rapho,</hi> upon which Captain <hi>Norman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Mogredg</hi> were ſent to hear his Propoſals, who at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn gave aſſurance of his Lordſhips being fully impower'd to Capitulate, and that he would on the ſurrender of the Garriſon, with our Arms, procure a Free and General Pardon for what was paſs't, (theſe Terms our two Envoys did earneſtly ſollicit us to accept, tho in vain.) But becauſe theſe two had no power to Conclude any thing, his Lordſhip deſired there might be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners with full power to treat with him at <hi>Mount-Gavelin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly the Governour <hi>George Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Captain <hi>Alexander Tomkins, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race Kennedy</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Lieutenant <hi>William Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhanks,</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>James Lennox,</hi> were impowr'd by the City to treat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, who after a full hearing of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Propoſals, would comply on no other Terms than the getting a Proteſtant Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and liberty to keep their Watches and Arms as formerly, as alſo a free and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pardon under the Great Seal, which his Lordſhip declared he could not grant, and ſo they parted without any Concluſion, his Lordſhip then ſaying, he wou'd next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning come to the Gates and demand En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. They returning with the report of theſe paſſages, we began to examine again the Stores of Amunition, and found only ſix Barrels of Powder, a few Arms unfix'd, and moſt of the Guns unmounted for want of Carriages. Soon after his Lordſhip ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at the Biſhops-Gate, where for ſome time he was made to ſtand, (upon a warm debate within, whether he ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.) At length out of reſpect to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he was ſuffered to enter, who being very importunate for an Accommodation; there were Eleven perſons of the City and Country appointed to treat with him, <hi>viz. George Phillips</hi> Governour, <hi>Horace Kennedy</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Captain <hi>Alexander Lecky,</hi> Captain <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Jemmet,</hi> Captain <hi>John Forward,</hi> Captain <hi>George Canning,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Henry Long,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant <hi>James Lennox, William Coningham,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>James Steward:</hi> His Lordſhip after ſome debate, that he might prevent any more Forces coming down upon us, was at laſt prevail'd on to agree to ſuch Articles as the City propoſed, which Articles are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next in the end.</p>
            <p>Upon the Perfection of theſe Articles, his Lordſhip for our better Satisfaction ordered Leiutenant Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> to repair to <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane,</hi> there to ſtop his ſix Companies, till the full Moyety being Papiſts were turned off, and ſome Officers of the City were ſent to ſee it done, and Proteſtants inliſted in their ſtead. Yet there were but two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies (all Proteſtants,) under Command of Leiutenant Collonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> and Captain <hi>Stewart,</hi> received at firſt into the City. The other four conſiſting of one half Papiſts, were ordered to quarter at <hi>Strabane, Newton, Stewart</hi> and <hi>Rapho,</hi> till throughly reform'd; Which ſo fully ſatisfied us, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Intereſt would be much ſtrengthned, by the interpoſition of the Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> that our Governour freely reſign'd his charge to him, and we all reſolv'd to follow his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99417:9"/>orders and directions. Accordingly his Lordſhip heartily Concurr'd with the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, advis'd 'em to repair the Carriages of the Guns, fix the old Arms that lay in the Stores, and every thing elſe that might be found neceſſary for the preſervation of the City. Whereupon there was a meeting in the <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> of all the Inhabitants in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Levying of Moneys for that purpoſe.

He cou'd procure no more than 42 Barrels of Powder, which (except 10 left in the County of <hi>Down,</hi>) happily came and was ſecured in the Magazine: Being alſo informed that a ſmall Bark which was ſent from <hi>Dublin,</hi> with 30 Barrels of Powder for the Earl of <hi>Antrim,</hi> lay Wind-bound at <hi>Killagh</hi> in the County of <hi>Down,</hi> there were perſons appointed to ſeize and bring the ſame about for our uſe; who did ſo, and leaving a ſhare in ſome truſty hands for the Countries Service, brought the remainder being about 20 Barrels to this City.

            <p>The Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> is ſent for to <hi>Dublin,</hi> by the Lord <hi>Tyrconnell:</hi> His Friends here all diſſwade him from going up.

                        <p>YOu have had an Account how long I ſtopt on the way after I left you, and the Reaſons which made me ſince come forward, and whatever my Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies were at my firſt Arrival, I am now fully ſatisfied with my coming, and with Gods Bleſſing hope it will come to good to us all. As ſoon as I ſaw my Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, he told me he intended to ſend me to the King, joyntly with the Lord Chief Baron, to lay before him the State of the Kingdom, and to tell him, If he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he would ruine it for him, and make it a heap of Rubbiſh; but it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to preſerve and make it of uſe to him; and therefore to deſire his leave to Treat for it. The Objections I made to this were two, My being not ſo well qualified for this, as another Roman Catholick, one to whom in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood the King would ſooner give Credit, and the Improbability of being able to perſwade the King, who is now in the <hi>French</hi> hands, to a thing that is ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt their Intereſt. To the firſt of theſe I was anſwered what is not fit for me to repeat; and the other was ſo well anſwered, that all the moſt knowing <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> men here are ſatisfied with it, and have deſired me to undertake this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I have done this Afteenoon: My Lord Deputy having firſt promiſed me upon his Word and Honour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the four particulars in the encloſed Paper. Now becauſe a thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot be done without being cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by ſome, who perhaps would be ſorry to have their Wiſhes by quiet means, and by others who think that all that Statesmen do are tricks, and that there is no ſincerity among them; I would have ſuch conſider that it is more probable, I, and the moſt intelligent men in this place, without whoſe advice I do nothing, ſhould judge righter of this, than they who are at a greater diſtance, and it is not likely we ſhould be fooled: So I hope they will not believe we deſign to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them, our ſelves, and our Nation. I am Morally aſſured, this muſt do our work without Blood, or the miſery of the Kingdom: I am ſure it is the way propoſed in <hi>England,</hi> who depend ſo on it, that no Forces are appointed to come hither; and I am ſure what I do, is not only what will be approved of in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but what has its beginning from thence: I do therefore conjure you to give your Friends and mine this Account, and for the love of God keep them from any Diſorder or Miſchief, if any had ſuch a Deſign, which I hope they had not, I ſhall write to this effect to ſome other parts, and I deſire you would let ſuch in your County as you think fit, ſee this; let the People fall to their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and think themſelves in leſs Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than they believ'd.</p>

            <p>His Lordſhip went ſoon after together with Chief Baron <hi>Rice</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> where inſtead of obtaining an Order for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to lay down their Arms, he was made a Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> deſigning to muſter up all his ſtrength againſt us, orders Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> to ſend up the four Companies which were not brought into the City, as well as the other two: But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than loſe ſo many good Arms, we were induc'd to receive 'em; and having well purg'd 'em of Papiſts, we unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concur and keep our joynt-Guards by detachments out of theſe 6 Companies, and our own 6 Town-Companies; which the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> being advertiſed of, iſſues a Proclamation to all parts of the North, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> therein from aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together, by way of Troops and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Proteſtants were too ſenſible of the neceſſity of defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to pay any great Deference to ſuch a Proclamation: And particularly at <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> they went on with their preparations for their own Safety, having been early encouraged thereto by the Nobility and Gentry of the Counties of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim,</hi> (who by a Meſſage ſent 'em by <hi>Will. Conningham,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> declared their Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what they had done, and aſſured 'em of their utmoſt Aſſiſtance:) But they were not altogether pleas'd with <hi>Lundy</hi>'s management of Affairs. He had againſt the mind of the Committee for the City, choſe Mr. <hi>Norman</hi> Lieutenant Collonel, and one
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99417:10"/>
               <hi>Hill</hi> Major to his Regiment. He ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcharged the City Companies from keeping their Guards, and refuſed 'em Ammunition: And when upon complaint made, he reſtor'd 'em, he would but allow one City Officer to the Guards, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to bring 'em under the Command of his own Officers. Theſe things diſguſted the City, but they thought it not a fit time to Contend about 'em.</p>
            <p>Having given this brief Account of what paſs'd at <hi>Derry,</hi> from the firſt ſhutting the Gates, till the Deſcent of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; it will not be improper to give ſome Relation of the moſt material paſſages that happened in other parts of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> before they approach'd thoſe Walls.</p>
            <p>The News of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was very acceptable to the Generality of the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe ſucceſs they hop'd would ſoon alter the ſcene of Affairs in that Kingdom. The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters in the Province of <hi>Ulster,</hi> with ſeveral Gentlemen of good Note there, were the firſt that agreed to ſend an Addreſs to the Prince: To this end they impowered Mr. <hi>Osborn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> being then at <hi>Dublin,</hi> to fix on the Perſon, who ſent Dr. <hi>Cummin, Decemb.</hi> 8th. the purport of the Addreſs (wherein they deſired nothing in particular for themſelves,) was, <hi>To Congratulate his Arrival and Succeſs hitherto in ſo glorious an Undertaking: To repreſent the Deplorable Condition of the Proteſtants in that Kingdom, and particularly in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and begg ſome ſpeedy Relief, aſſuring him of their readineſs to ſerve his Interest to the utmost of their Power.</hi> All the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters afterwards in behalf of themſelves, and their Congregations ſent another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulatory Addreſs, dated <hi>January</hi> 22d. by two of their number, Mr. <hi>Patrick Adair,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Abernethy.</hi> The <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of that Province were univerſally ſenſible of the Dangers that then threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 'em: For beſides thoſe mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they obſerv'd that the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was daily iſſuing out vaſt numbers of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions for levying of Men: That the Collonels were empowered to make up as many Companies as they could: That the Captains were to maintain their own Companies for 3 Months at their own Charge, who were moſt of 'em ſo unable to ſupport themſelves, that the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> order'd they ſhould have their Commiſſions without paying any fees; and many of 'em were forc'd to leave 'em in pawn, for what they had already run on the ſcore. They ſoon ſaw how ſuch a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous Crew were deſigned to ſubſiſt. While they were only Rapparee's, they were well vers'd in the Arts of Thefts and Rapine: And being now liſted in the Army, they thought they might practiſe 'em with ſome kind of Authority: So that in a Month or two there was ſcarce a Proteſtant in moſt Counties (where the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> were not upon their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) that had either any Stock left on their Land, or any Horſes in their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. And all Complaints of theſe Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies met with ſo little Countenance or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, that the Lord Deputy ſeemed to have rais'd ſo many ſwarms of <hi>Banditti</hi> and <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> rather than <hi>Souldiers</hi> under <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> and Commiſſion'd 'em to <hi>plunder</hi> and <hi>ruinate</hi> the Countrey, rather than <hi>ſecure</hi> and defend it.</p>
            <p>All this Allarm'd the Proteſtants of the <hi>North,</hi> who ſaw their numbers were their only Security againſt the ſame Violences being as generally practiſed among them. They therefore Conſulted their own Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ordered ſtrong Guards to be kept: The firſt Project they fell upon, was the diſarming Sir <hi>Tho. Newcomen</hi>'s Regiment, quarter'd at <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> and <hi>Lisburn,</hi> in order to their making themſelves Maſters of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickfergus.</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> diſcours'd and prevail'd on ſeveral of the Proteſtant Officers in the Regiment, to concurr with 'em in this Deſign. He had ordered alſo a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable party to be ready at the ſame time for ſurprizing the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Garriſon at the <hi>Newry.</hi> The 4th of <hi>January</hi> was the day for putting it in Execution, the Proteſtant Guards were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of it: Sir <hi>Athur Rawden,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Mac Gill,</hi> march't from <hi>Moyra</hi> at the hour they had appointed, with 500 Horſe and Foot: Lieutenants <hi>Tubman</hi> and <hi>Berry</hi> took the Guard at <hi>Lisburn, Tubman</hi> put all the Papiſts Arms under the Proteſtant Guard. Captain <hi>Obrey</hi> of <hi>Lisburn,</hi> had a ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Horſe ready, and actually ſeized 25 of the Souldiers Muſquets: But when all things were thus ready, and the Execution of this Deſign, was as they thought, ſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99417:10"/>eaſie and ſecure, Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Mac Gill,</hi> were met within three miles of <hi>Lisburn,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Tilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> who came to acquaint 'em that the Gentlemen at <hi>Belfaſt</hi> could not do what was deſired from 'em; they ſaid they had not notice early enough, (Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither before 9 a clock that Night, when the Souldiers were in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:) They objected the ill conſequences might enſue from the doing of it to the Town of <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> if they ſhould afterwards fail of ſecuring <hi>Carickfergus;</hi> and therefore urged the delaying it till they had more fully concerted their meaſures, and put the Countrey into a better poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: Upon this Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Mac Gill,</hi> were forc'd to diſperſe their men, tho not without great reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and regrett at the diſappointment. Mr. <hi>Ham.</hi> of <hi>Tillimore,</hi> upon his Return thought fit to try Sir <hi>Tho. Newcomen</hi> (who profeſs'd himſelf a Proteſtant) to ingage him to joyn with him in their common defence: which diſcourſe ſo allarm'd his ſuſpution, that he put himſelf on his Guard, barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed the ſtreets of <hi>Lisburn,</hi> ſent to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Carickfergus</hi> to take care of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who upon this Warning ſent for the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Regiment, and part of <hi>Cormack Oneil's</hi> to ſtrengthen the Garriſon. But ſeveral of the Proteſtant Officers in Sir <hi>Tho. Newcomens</hi> Regiment, with 120 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers deſerted, and the Officers ſent their Commiſſions to their Collonel. Sir <hi>Tho. Newcomen</hi> ſoon after took his opportunity when moſt of the Gentlemen in that part of the Countrey were at <hi>Mount Alexander,</hi> to march off with his Regiment towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> and he narrowly eſcaped being diſarmed by the Rabble themſelves. The Proteſtant No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry could not but foreſee theſe proceedings would incenſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and draw down an Army on 'em as ſoon as the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> could be ready with his new levies: And therefore to be better prepared for what they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they agreed to enter into Aſſociations in the ſeveral Counties for ſelf-defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe illegal Outrages. (See in the end.) The Counties of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Antrim</hi> nominated the Lord <hi>Mount Alexander,</hi> (and the latter added Mr. <hi>Skeffington,</hi>) for their Commander in Chief, as thoſe of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> and <hi>Monagham,</hi> did the Lord <hi>Blany:</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Derry, Donegal,</hi> and <hi>Tyrone,</hi> Collonel <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and Major <hi>Guſtavus Hamilton:</hi> They choſe <hi>Councils</hi> or <hi>Committees</hi> for every County, and appointed a General Council of <hi>Union,</hi> at <hi>Hillsborough,</hi> for all the aſſociated Counties of <hi>Ulſter.</hi> Theſe Councils or Committees choſe the Field Officers, and applyed themſelves to thoſe Miniſters that had the greateſt influence on the People for raiſing their Men. Some of the Gentlemen that raiſed Regiments, having no publick Fund, arm'd and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd 'em at their own Charge. The Conſult order'd the following Regiments to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Antrim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Regiment of Horſe, conſiſting of twelve Troops, out of both theſe Counties, the Earl of Mount</hi> Alexander <hi>Collonel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Regiment of Dragoons, out of the County of Down, Sir</hi> Arthur Rawden <hi>Collonel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Regiment of Dragoons out of the County of</hi> Antrim, <hi>Mr.</hi> Clotworthy Skeffington <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel:</hi> But this Regiment was not rais'd, but a Regiment of Foot inſtead of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Four Regiments of Foot, out of each of the ſaid Counties: in the County of</hi> Antrim, <hi>Sir</hi> William Franklin, <hi>Mr.</hi> Upton, <hi>Mr.</hi> Leſley, <hi>and Mr. Adair</hi> rais'd each of them a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: There was another in and about <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> deſign'd for Captain <hi>Leighton,</hi> and 300 Foot were rais'd by Mr. <hi>Edmonston.</hi> In the County of <hi>Down,</hi> Sir <hi>John Mac Gill,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Colvil, James Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Tillimore,</hi> and <hi>James Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Bangor,</hi> Eſquires, raiſed each a Regiment, and Capt. <hi>Francis Anneſley</hi> rais'd ſome Horſe and Foot.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the Counties of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> were equally forward in their levies.</p>
            <p>It was reſolved alfo in the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, to ſend a Gentleman into <hi>England</hi> with an Addreſs to the then Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and Captain <hi>Baldwin Leighton</hi> was choſen, who accordingly ſail'd from <hi>Belfaſt, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> the 10th.</p>
            <p>The frontier Garriſons of <hi>Down,</hi> (being but inconſiderable and unwalled Villages,) were at firſt maintained by Sir <hi>Arthur Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> (his Lieutenant Collonel Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> concurring with him) but afterwards the Countrey contributed to the Expence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſult</hi> had ordered the ſurprizal of <hi>Carickfergus;</hi> ſome Proteſtants in the Town were acquainted with it, and the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99417:11"/>deſign laid, <hi>Febr.</hi> 21. in the night, 1000 foot march from <hi>Belfaſt</hi> towards it, under the Command of Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micham,</hi> and Major <hi>Baker;</hi> but the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being bad, and the way tedious, it was clear day before they reach'd the Town; when they were within a mile of it, <hi>Bremicham</hi> ſtop'd 'em, on pretence of two paſſages in a Letter he had from the Lord <hi>Mount Alexander,</hi> Sir <hi>William Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Tillimore:</hi> The one was, That he ſhould do nothing in <hi>Carick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus,</hi> without Mr. <hi>Henry Davis</hi>'s Advice, (who was then in the Town.) The other that they would be with him at the hour of Action. The Garriſon thro this delay, had ſo much notice of their approach, as enabled 'em to put themſelves in ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Defence. The Earl of <hi>Mount Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden,</hi> and other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, came with 4 or 500 Horſe, not doubting the ſucceſs of the Foot, but found the foremoſt party of 'em, and thoſe on the Walls firing at one another. <hi>Mark Talbot,</hi> Lieutenant Collonel to the Earl of <hi>Antrim,</hi> came out to know the reaſon of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. He was told the ſtores of <hi>Carick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus</hi> had been always under a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Governour: That being now in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands, they came to demand it for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> eſpecially to prevent the Inſolencies and Robberies of the Souldiers: They alſo offer'd terms to the Garriſon, which <hi>Talbot</hi> promiſed to acquaint the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi> with: Upon his return it was agreed, <q>That Collonel <hi>Cormack Oneal,</hi> who had then his Regiment in Town, ſhould disband it, and lay down his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; and he and they having Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to return to their ſeveral dwellings: That the Garriſon ſhould be kept by a few of the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Regiment, who ſhould never have above a weeks Proviſions at once: That the Proteſtants in Town ſhould have a Guard as well as the Papiſts, of equal number, without any diſturbance from the Caſtle: That the value of what had been plundered, ſhould be reſtored: That all Letters from the Papiſts to <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſhould be ſent open to the Conſult at <hi>Hillsborough,</hi> and particularly ſuch a Letter ſent from the Earl of <hi>Antrim,</hi> and <hi>Cormack O Neal,</hi> by one of their number, to give the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> an Account of that Affair as he Proteſtants ſhould approve of.</q> A Letter was accordingly ſent, ſign'd by both ſides, but Fryar <hi>O Haggerty</hi> was (upon Mr. <hi>Randal Brice</hi>'s Recommendation) ſuffered to be the Bearer, who underſtood as much as any in the Garriſon could dictate to him, and gave the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> the following (too true). Account of the Condition of the North, <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>That they were untrain'd, and had few experienced Officers: That the moſt part were without Arms, and ſuch as had 'em, their Arms were unfixt and unfit for ſervice. They were very much ſcattered, and their number not near what had been written, and was confidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in</hi> Dublin, <hi>that they wanted all Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and neceſſary Proviſions for appearing in the Field.</hi>] The Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> (who had deferred for 20 days to ſend down his Army, after it had been firſt agreed on in Council) upon this Information reſolved to diſpatch the moſt Conſiderable and beſt trained part of it, under the Command of Lieutenant General <hi>Hamilton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the 23d. of <hi>February,</hi> to the 11th. of <hi>March,</hi> ſeveral Skirmiſhes happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Iriſh Garriſon at <hi>Newry,</hi> or the Rapparees, and the Frontier Garriſons of the <hi>North.</hi> The latter being frequently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to reſcue Preys of Cattel which thoſe Ravenous Beaſts ſeiz'd and endeavour'd to carry away.</p>
            <p>Two Letters from <hi>Dublin,</hi> one of the 22d. the other of the 25th. of <hi>February,</hi> arrived in the <hi>North,</hi> one giving an account of the preparations making againſt 'em at <hi>Dublin,</hi> the other relating the diſarming the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants there. But their confident expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Succors from <hi>England,</hi> and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of <hi>Tyrconnels</hi> fears, made them too ſlow in their meaſures. They did indeed ſend to C. <hi>Lundy</hi> at <hi>Derry,</hi> to bring down what he cou'd ſpare of the Forces of <hi>Derry, Tyrone,</hi> and <hi>Donnegal</hi> to their aſſiſtance, and offer'd him the Command of their whole Army. C. <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> promiſed to bring with him 1000 men well appointed out of each of the three Counties, with a train of Artillery, and to be with 'em on a certain day, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Fortnight before the Deſcent of the Iriſh Army. Upon which the Conſult or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Hillsbrough</hi> to be ſtockt with all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary proviſions for an Army: But C. <hi>Lundy</hi> failed their expectations in this, as he did
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99417:11"/>in every thing elſe afterwards, that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their common ſafety.</p>
            <p>The 9th. of <hi>March,</hi> Captain <hi>Leighton</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with a Letter, [ſee in the end] from his Majeſty to the Earl of <hi>Mount Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> to be communicated to the reſt of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> approving their endeavours for their own defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He brought over alſo Commiſſions for all the Regiments in the Counties of <hi>Antrim, Down, Ardmagh</hi> and <hi>Monaghan,</hi> except two that were not raiſed when Captain <hi>Leighton</hi> left the <hi>North,</hi> and aſſured 'em of ſpeedy relief, telling them ſome of the Cannon and Ammunition were ſhipt, and 15000 men rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at the Waterſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon his coming King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in the Towns that were in the North-Eaſt part of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> (with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Duty and Affection, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their high obligations to their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, as well as their hopes from 'em,) and in ſome before his Arrival.</p>
            <p>The ſame day Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> arrived at <hi>Hillsborough</hi> with a Meſſage which the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> had permitted him to deliver. But the real deſign of his coming was to prevent their being ſurprized with the deſcent of the Iriſh Army, to give 'em the beſt infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and advice in order to their defence, to which he earneſtly urged 'em; a fuller account whereof the Reader may ſee in his <hi>Vindication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11th. of <hi>March,</hi> the Iriſh Army came to <hi>Newry,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> being then at <hi>Loch-bricklan,</hi> ſent to the Conſult for more Forces to defend that place: But being that Night informed that the whole Iriſh Army would be there next Morning, and the Conſult acquainting him that they had no Forces ready to be ſent, and adviſing him to retire to <hi>Dromore,</hi> he ordered the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants that Night to pack up their Goods, ſent his Foot to Guard them, and with his Horſe ſecured their retreat. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants went on to <hi>Belfast</hi> and the Sea Coaſts.</p>
            <p>12th. of <hi>March,</hi> the Garriſon at <hi>Rathfry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with the Inhabitants abandoned the place, and came to <hi>Dromore,</hi> and that Night the Iriſh Army came to <hi>Loch-bricklan.</hi> This day Cap. <hi>Hugh Mac-Gill</hi> brought his Troop of 80 Dragoons from the <hi>Ardes</hi> to <hi>Dromore;</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> ſent to <hi>Hillsbrough</hi> for an 100 good Musketeers, but they came not, nor the other Forces expected from other parts.</p>
            <p>13th. of <hi>March,</hi> the Iriſh Army Marched towards <hi>Dromore.</hi> This Night Major <hi>Baker</hi> brought four Companies of Foot to <hi>Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> but very ill Armed: The Officers put what Horſe and Foot they had into the beſt poſture they could, and ſent to <hi>Hills<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi> for Powder and Arms.</p>
            <p>14th. of <hi>March,</hi> the Expreſs returned with ſome Powder, but the Bullets were unſuitable to their unſizable Arms. The Expreſs alſo brought Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to retire next Night with his Men to <hi>Hillsbrough.</hi> Upon which they reſolved to quit the Town, expecting that the reſt of the Forces of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Antrim</hi> would be that Night at <hi>Lisburn,</hi> and advance from thence the next day to <hi>Hillsbrough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame day the Presbiterian Miniſters appeared before the Conſult with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals mentioned in Mr. <hi>Osborns</hi> Vindication, and the Country was ſummoned to appear the 19th, at <hi>Blariſmore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the Scouts acquaints the Officers at <hi>Dromore,</hi> that about two Troops of Iriſh Horſe were marching towards the Town, upon which the Horſe and Dragoons were drawn up in the Street; the four Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Foot were alſo drawn up at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Town. The Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons went on and fac't a party of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, till they diſcovered the whole Body of the Iriſh Army coming on them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no ſtrength capable to oppoſe them, their Foot went off, and their Horſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make good their retreat: Some few of the Horſe and Dragoons, and ſome of the Country people that were carrying off their Goods, were killed.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the Lord <hi>Mount Alexander,</hi> Collonel <hi>Upton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limore,</hi> upon advice hereof, got together what Horſe they could at <hi>Hillsbrough,</hi> (which were not many,) and were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Town to aſſiſt thoſe of <hi>Dromore,</hi> when they met their foremoſt party on their retreat, they rallied as many as they could of that flying party, ſent to <hi>Lisburn</hi> for the Forces that were there to the number of near 4000. Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> Rode thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haſten them up, but the precipitant motion of the Iriſh Army ſtruck ſuch a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror into the people who were but ill armed,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99417:12"/>that few would ſtay at <hi>Hillsbrough,</hi> ſo that they were forced to leave it to the Iriſh, who ſeized the Proviſions and the little Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition laid up there, beſides the Papers of the Conſult. Moſt of the Forces alſo at <hi>Lisburn</hi> ſhrunk and ſtole away; their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in this confuſion could not agree on any poſt thereabouts which they were able to defend againſt a well appointed Army; their hopes of ſpeedy aſſiſtance from the other Counties, as well as from <hi>England</hi> were fruſtrated, and ſo they reſolved upon ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for themſelves. All the Gentlemen of the Lower parts of the County of <hi>Down,</hi> (except Captain <hi>Hugh Mac-Gill</hi> and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) endeavoured to tranſport themſelves. Others reſolved to ſtay and defend their Country to the laſt extremity, as Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> and moſt of his Regiment; part of Sir <hi>John Mac-Gills</hi> Regiment, under the Command of Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Whitney:</hi> Part of Sir <hi>William Franklins,</hi> under the Command of Major <hi>Tubman:</hi> Collonel <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Upton</hi> with part of his Regiment, Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Adairs</hi> Regiment, under the Command of Collonel <hi>Edmonſton,</hi> Major <hi>Stroud</hi> with his own Troop, Captain <hi>Clotworthy Upton</hi> with his Troop, being one of the Earl of <hi>Mount Alexander</hi>'s Regiment: One Troop of <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> Commanded by Captain <hi>White.</hi> All theſe Forces being about 4000 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, marched to <hi>Colerain,</hi> the reſt either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into <hi>England,</hi> or took Protections from the Iriſh, but all the Collonels went either to <hi>Derry,</hi> or out of the Kingdom, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Collonel <hi>Leſley,</hi> who choſe rather to take Protection; and helpt to Victual the Iriſh Camp before <hi>Derry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Garriſon of <hi>Dungannon,</hi> I need give only this ſhort Relation: <hi>Dungannon</hi> in the County of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> being in great danger from the Iriſh Garriſon in <hi>Charlemont,</hi> (that had above 30 Companies in it,) the defence of it by a good Garriſon was thought very neceſſary. And accordingly the Counties of <hi>Tyrone, Derry,</hi> and <hi>Donegall,</hi> ſent in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Troops and Companies by turns, which were maintained partly by the Country, partly by their Officers. About the 11th. of <hi>February,</hi> the Iriſh gathered together in great Numbers near <hi>Stewarts Town</hi> and <hi>Gleno.</hi> Collonel <hi>Stewart</hi> Commanded a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach't party of our men (about 24. ſome of Captain <hi>Stewart</hi> of <hi>Killemonts</hi> Troop, and ſome Foot) to go and view them, who kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſome of the Iriſh, and took 13 or 14 Priſoners. Soon after, a conſiderable party of the Forces of <hi>Charlemont,</hi> joyned with othey Iriſh of the Countrey near <hi>Benburb:</hi> A party of our men both Foot and Horſe, beat them off, and took a prey of Cattel from them, as they did ſeveral afterwards. Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> about the 14th. of <hi>March,</hi> ſent his Orders to Collonel <hi>Stewart</hi> to quit the Town, which accordingly he did, tho a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the opinion of moſt of the Officers. Nor was there any care taken to carry off that great quantity of Proviſions, which the Country about had ſent in, ſo that they fell into the Enemies hands. About the 16th. or 17th. of <hi>March,</hi> ſome of the Garriſon marched towards <hi>Colerain,</hi> others towards <hi>Derry,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> and his Company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The 11th. a party of our men beat off a party of the Iriſh, who had taken up the paſs at <hi>Toam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Forces raiſed by the Lord <hi>Blaney,</hi> I ſhall give the Reader a breif account out of a Memoir of his own.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Being choſen by the Counties of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> and <hi>Monaghan,</hi> to Command all the Forces raiſed, and to be raiſed for the Proteſtant Service there, after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Dragoons at <hi>Armagh,</hi> I poſted my ſelf there, and at a general Rendezvouz of the Inhabitants of the County, found their number to be about 1800 men, indifferently well armed.</p>
               <p>There was at this time at the Fort of <hi>Charlemont,</hi> which is within 5 Miles of the Town, near 3000 of the Enemy, who were very inſolent, upon the account they received of an Armies being ſent from <hi>Dublin,</hi> to reduce the Northern Rebels (as they call'd us) to Obedience.</p>
               <p>This made them for a forthnight toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt the Plundering all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Houſes near the Town, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oblig'd to defend 'em, ſeveral Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes happened between our Parties, the Proteſtants always prevailing; inſomuch that conſiderable numbers of the Enemy were every day kill'd, and we only ſuffer'd the loſs of one Man.</p>
               <p>Thus it continued 'till <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 13th. of <hi>March,</hi> at which time I heard that my own Houſe at <hi>Mona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>an</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that all the Forces of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99417:12"/>County were retreated to <hi>Glaſslough,</hi> and beſieg'd there by the Enemy: Sir <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Atchiſon</hi> came the ſame day from the North, and inform'd me that Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> had quitted <hi>Lough Brickland,</hi> and that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army under the Conduct of Lieutenant General <hi>Hamilton</hi> had poſſeſt themſelves of that place. A Council of War was then call'd of all the Officers in the Town, where it was reſolved that we ſhould the next day March to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the relief of thoſe which were beſieg'd at <hi>Glaſslough,</hi> and if we could bring off the Proteſtant Party there, we ſhould March through <hi>Dungannon</hi> to <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Antrim,</hi> to joyn with our Friends there. The ſame day a Party of the Enemy were beat off by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants at <hi>Tonragee,</hi> and ſeveral of 'em kill'd.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Of the Affair of <hi>Glaſslough,</hi> I ſhall begg leave to inſert the following Relation from another hand.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Thoſe of <hi>Glaſslough</hi> having Orders from my Lord <hi>Blaney</hi> to March towards <hi>Antrim,</hi> Notice was given to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to be there that Night or the next Morning: The <hi>Iriſh</hi> having intelligence of it, beſet the Roads to Rob 'em; upon which Capt. <hi>Ancktall</hi> mounted 20 of his Horſe, and Capt. <hi>Richardſon</hi> with 7 Files of Foot went out and fell on the Robbers, they kill'd 6, the reſt flying to the Woods and Boggs. Capt. <hi>Cole</hi> with his Troop of Horſe, and 2 Foot Companies, came hither, and it was concluded to March that day: But we were immediately alarm'd with the Account of a Body of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Foot coming towards us: It was agreed to go out and fight 'em: the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had poſſeſs'd themſelves of an old <hi>Daniſh</hi> Fort, within leſs than half a Mile of the Town. We detach'd 100 Fire-locks, and all the Horſe of 2 Troops fit for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: The Enemy who had fired at us while at a great diſtance, upon our near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er approach, ſally'd out and fir'd a Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at our Men: But Captain <hi>Ancktall</hi> with his Horſe came ſo ſuddainly on them, and purſu'd 'em ſo cloſe, as they were retreating into the Fort, that the Enemy within ſeeing ſeveral kill'd, and others trod under the Horſes Feet, threw down their Arms, and betook themſelves to their heels: They were about five to one in number, and yet there were (as Mr. <hi>Anthony</hi> who ſtay'd in the Country told us) 180 of 'em kill'd, among whom was Collonel <hi>Mackennah,</hi> 4 Captains, 6 Lieutenants, and 6 Enſigns: We only loſt that brave Man Capt. <hi>Ancktall,</hi> who after the Enemy was routed, was unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhot by a Fellow that lay in a Buſh. More of the Enemy had been cut off, if they had not had a Bogg to retreat to: But after this encounter, we had only ſo much Ammunition left us, as ſerv'd to Charge our Arms on our March. —</p>
               <p>On <hi>Fryday</hi> the 15th. I heard that the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Counties of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Antrim</hi> were broken, and retired to <hi>Colerain,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Advice I march'd thither with 300 Horſe and as many Foot, being all that were left me of the 1800 I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, the others having taken Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the Enemy. On the Road between <hi>Dungannon</hi> and <hi>Monimore,</hi> I met at <hi>Artrea</hi> 1000 of the Enemy, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqued us, but we were ſo ſucceſsful as to beat them, and kill 140 of them; all the Country People thereabouts general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fled to <hi>Colerain</hi> with the Army, except a few. The Gentlemen in the Country in other parts were very active, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi> and Captain <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Sanderſon,</hi> in the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> who were 2 of the 10 excepted from Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Proclamation.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Of the Forces raiſed by the Lord <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> I had the following relation from his Lordſhip.</p>
            <q>
               <p>On the 4th. of <hi>January,</hi> 1688. the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the County of <hi>Sligo</hi> met and aſſociated themſelves, and choſe the right honourable <hi>Robert</hi> Lord Baron of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> and the honourable Capt. <hi>Chidley Coot,</hi> their chief Commanders, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Obedience to both or either of them, and then formed themſelves into Troops and Companies, and furniſhed their Men with Horſes, Arms, Ammunition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and order'd frontier Garriſons to be kept, as <hi>Grange</hi> in the way to <hi>Bally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhanny,</hi> to hold Correſpondence with <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and the Places adjacent: Garriſons were alſo put into <hi>New-Town</hi> and <hi>Mannor Hamilton,</hi> to keep Correſpondence with <hi>Inniskillin,</hi> my Lord <hi>Bellimont</hi>'s Houſe at
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99417:13"/>
                  <hi>Killoona,</hi> Dr. <hi>Leſlie</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi>'s at <hi>Mercury,</hi> was the Frontier Garriſons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Boyle</hi> and <hi>Ballymoat,</hi> to prevent the Incurſions of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> from thoſe parts. There was alſo a Garriſon at <hi>Cottlestown,</hi> in the fartheſt part of the County of <hi>Sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> to obſerve the Motions of the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rais'd Army in the County of <hi>Mayo,</hi> which was very numerous. Soon after the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Killalla</hi> had quitted his Houſe, there was one <hi>Tremble,</hi> a Servant to Sir <hi>Arthur Gore</hi> barbarouſly Murther'd by Capt. <hi>Walter Bourk</hi> and his Soldiers.</p>
               <p>Coll. <hi>Mackdonnel</hi> being Garriſon'd at <hi>Boyle,</hi> and not permitting any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to paſs with their Goods and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions towards the Garriſon of <hi>Sligo,</hi> but ordering all ſuch Goods and Proviſions to be ſeized: — It was thought fit he ſhould be writ to, deſiring him to let the Proteſtants have free Paſſage to <hi>Sligo,</hi> as all the Papiſts had from thence to <hi>Boyle, Athlone,</hi> and other Places, to their <hi>Iriſh</hi> Friends, without any moleſtation from the Garriſon of <hi>Sligo;</hi> but he not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what was deſired, it was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Lord <hi>Kingſton,</hi> and Captain <hi>Chidley Coote,</hi> ſhould with a Party of Horſe and Foot March to <hi>Boyle,</hi> and demand a free Paſſage for the Proteſtants, which the Coll. readily granted, but never perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though we lookt on him as one of the faireſt Reputation among the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in thoſe parts. It is to be obſerved, that the Collonel upon the approach of our Party, drew all his Horſe, Foot and Dragoons, within the Walls of the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi>'s Houſe and Gardens, though with his old Troops and Rapparees he had at leaſt five to one in and about the place.</p>
               <p>About 5 of our Horſe, Commanded by Captain <hi>Arthur Cooper,</hi> went to view what the <hi>Iriſh</hi> deſign'd at <hi>Ballimont,</hi> then Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon'd by a Company of Foot, under the Command of Capt. <hi>Terence Mac Donogh,</hi> he drew 'em up to face our Men; but they firing on 'em, and with the ſhot of one Blunderbuſs killing one, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five more, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> threw down their Arms and run to the Caſtle, our Men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing and beating 'em to the Draw-bridge.</p>

               <p>During the ſtay of the Forces at <hi>Sligo,</hi> frequent Correſpondence was kept with <hi>Derry,</hi> ſometimes with Collonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> and ſometimes with the Committee; and at <hi>Inniskillin</hi> with the Governor of that place, Coll. <hi>Guſtavus Hamilton.</hi> Many Letters came to <hi>Sligo,</hi> from Coll. <hi>Lundy</hi> and the Committee, to March the Forces to <hi>Derry;</hi> it being alledged by them, that if the Northern Forces were conquered, that muſt fall of courſe. By this time the Stone-Fort at <hi>Sligo</hi> was finiſhed, and the Sodd-fort new made up, at the Coſt of the Officers, and Labour of the Soldiers.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were at <hi>Sligo,</hi> there was an open Market kept, where the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts as well as the Proteſtants had the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and diſpoſing of what Commodities they brought thither: Yet ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Sligo</hi> was quitted, ſeveral of the Brittiſh coming thither, from <hi>Tirrearagh,</hi> with great ſtore of Meal, Cattle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Iriſh</hi> that were got into an old Caſtle, belonging to Captain <hi>Henry Crofton,</hi> (an inveterate Roman Catholick) robbed and plundered all the Brittiſh of their Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and made a ſtore of it in the Caſtle; of which an Account coming to the Lord <hi>Kingſton,</hi> his Lordſhip immediately ſent in the Night Captain <hi>William Ormsby,</hi> and Captain <hi>Francis Gore,</hi> with a detached party of men out of every Troop and Company under their Command, and the next Morning before day the Lord <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> March't with another party to aſſiſt them (if there had been occaſion,) but his Lordſhip met Cornet <hi>Charles Nicol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> who gave him an account that our party had got the Caſtle by ſetting Fire to the Gate, and ſmoaking the Enemy out, who at firſt fired very briskly upon our men, yet we loſt none: — We found great ſtore of Proviſions, of Meal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſeventeen Muskets belonging to the Iriſh Army, with ſeveral half Pikes, Iriſh Daggers, and Rapparee's Swords; the Proteſtants had their Corn and Cattle returned 'em, or a Market rate paid them for ſo much of their Corn as they could ſpare.</p>
               <p>Several Letters were written from time
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99417:13"/>to time to Collonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> for a ſupply of Arms and Ammunition for the Garriſon of <hi>Sligo,</hi> but none could be had; 'till at laſt a Ship came to <hi>Derry</hi> from <hi>Scotland</hi> with Ammunition, and then Coll. <hi>Lundy</hi> conſented to let <hi>Sligo</hi> have three Barrels of Powder, and <hi>Ballyſhanny</hi> one, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five Pounds <hi>per</hi> Barrel were paid for it; but though a Bill of twenty Pounds was immediately ſent for that end, yet none of it ever came to <hi>Sligo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the 20th. of <hi>March,</hi> an Expreſs came to <hi>Sligo</hi> from Coll. <hi>Lundy,</hi> to haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our March with all ſpeed to <hi>Derry;</hi> which Letter, as all others that came from Coll. <hi>Lundy</hi> or the Committee, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to all our Officers, but the laſt Letter that came was miſlay'd by Capt. <hi>Coote;</hi> and on the ſame day a Council of War (if then it might be ſo term'd) was called, and a ſpeedy March to <hi>Derry</hi> was Voted, by the Officers who had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to make 'em ſo, but ſuch as the Gentlemen they had choſen for their chief had given 'em: The Names of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers of that Council were, (as follows) Major <hi>Owen Vaughan,</hi> Major <hi>Thomas Hart,</hi> Captain <hi>Hugh Morgan,</hi> Captain <hi>Piercy Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thins,</hi> Captain <hi>Edward Woods,</hi> Captain <hi>William Ormesby,</hi> Captain <hi>William Smith,</hi> Captain <hi>William Griffith,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Brooke,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Adam Ormesby,</hi> and Cornet <hi>Oliver Brookes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 21ſt. being the next day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the Council was called again, where it was hotly preſſed and Voted to march Northward, and accordingly all things were prepared againſt the next day, and then a March began; the Foot, Baggage, with ſome Horſe in the rear, March'd out early in the Morning, the reſt attending the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi> till they had broke the Trunnions, and nailed the heavier Guns, and ſent off the ſmalleſt by Boat, and ſtaved all the reſt they could find; but thoſe ſent away were put into an Iſland by ſtorm, which next day were taken by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> by help of ſome Boats that were concealed by them.</p>
               <p>On the 24th. the Forces with Bag and Baggage arrived ſafe at <hi>Ballyſhanny,</hi> Lieut. Coll. <hi>Connell Farrell</hi> was ordered to hinder and oppoſe us with 180 Fire-locks from <hi>Boyle,</hi> with the <hi>Dartry-Iriſh,</hi> to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of four or five hundred, who attempted the breaking down of <hi>Bondrons-bridg,</hi> which they quitted upon the approach of about fifty of our Horſe, and took the Boggs, and never oppoſed us in one Paſs, though there were many dangerous ones, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few might hinder the Paſſage of a great many, had they had Courage to do it.</p>
               <p>Either on the way, or at <hi>Ballyſhanny,</hi> a Letter came to the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi> from the Committee at <hi>Derry,</hi> with Orders (as they ſaid) from Coll. <hi>Lundy</hi> to ſtay at <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſhanny,</hi> and keep the Paſſes on the <hi>Earne Water,</hi> (which was obey'd, he having his preſent Majeſty's Commiſſion.)</p>
               <p>The Garriſon of <hi>Ballyſhanny,</hi> under the Command of Capt. <hi>Folliot,</hi> was now reinforced, and the Ferry-boat of that place ſunk, and the Lord <hi>Folliot</hi>'s Houſe, with other Houſes on <hi>Connaught</hi>-ſide the Water were burnt, to prevent the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's ſheltring themſelves therein, and from thence annoying us with their ſhot, and one Arch more of <hi>Balleek-bridge</hi> was pulled down, part being ſo ſerved by Sir <hi>James Caldwell</hi> before, and a Garriſon left there under the Command of Major <hi>Vaughan,</hi> and Lieut. <hi>Arthur Cooper,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Garriſon left at <hi>Mulick,</hi> being the Houſe of Lieut. <hi>Walter Johnſon,</hi> under the Command of Capt. <hi>William Smith,</hi> Capt. <hi>Francis King,</hi> and Lieut. <hi>Toby Mulloy,</hi> to obſerve and guard a Ford at the mouth of <hi>Lough-Earn:</hi> and at the ſame time ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party was ordered to keep the Caſtle and Town of <hi>Dunnegal,</hi> being Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Capt. <hi>Francis Gore,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Woods.</hi> During the time of the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi> and his Party's being at <hi>Bally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhanny</hi> and the Places before mentioned, there came ſeveral Expreſſes, inviting the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi> with Eighty of his choiceſt Horſe and three Hundred Foot to <hi>Derry,</hi> with Promiſes of Proviſion ſhould be made for 'em: But the Party having been all along together, they were all of 'em againſt breaking, 'till ſomething ſhould happen, by which they might ſhew their Zeal to his preſent Majeſty's ſervice and the Proteſtant Religion; and accordingly ſtaid there 'till a Letter came to the Lord <hi>Kingſton,</hi> ſign'd at a Council of War at <hi>Derry, April</hi> the 13th. Ordering the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99417:14"/>under his Command, as well as all others to be at <hi>Clady, Lifford,</hi> and <hi>Long Cauſey,</hi> or the places near to 'em, on Monday the 15th of <hi>April,</hi> by 10 a clock in the Morning. This Letter came not to the Lord <hi>Kingston</hi> till the 14th of <hi>April,</hi> at ten a Clock that Night, and the neareſt of his Forces were 30 miles from the place of Rendevouz. Upon this the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi> called a Council of War, wherein it was concluded, That tho it was impoſſible for the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi> and his Party to be at any of the Places abovementioned, in twice the time limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi> himſelf, with ten or twelve Horſe, ſhould the next Morning go towards <hi>Derry,</hi> to ſee how matters were, and to give Directions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to his Party: Very early the next Morning his Lordſhip went, but when his Lordſhip came to <hi>Strannor</hi>-lane, within five miles of <hi>Rapho,</hi> his Lordſhip met with ſeveral of the Brittiſh running from <hi>Cladyford,</hi> who gave his Lordſhip an Account, that the Brittiſh were fled with Coll. <hi>Lundy</hi> into <hi>Derry,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were got to <hi>Rapho,</hi> between his Lordſhip and that place; whereupon his Lordſhip haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened back to <hi>Dunegal,</hi> and ſent an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs with orders for the Horſe, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves in <hi>Iniskilling,</hi> and the Foot at <hi>Dunegal, Ballishany,</hi> and other places: And then the Lord <hi>Kingston</hi> with ſome of his Officers, went to <hi>Killibeggs,</hi> and took Shipping, and were put into <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whence his Lordſhip haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to give his Majeſty an Account of Affairs, hoping to have made a quick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Party, with his Majeſties Commiſſions and Orders.</p>
            </q>
            <p>So unhappily were the deſigns of that Noble Lord, (who inherits the Courage as well as the Honour of his Father,) for the preſervation of that part of the Countrey, which he proſecuted with extraordinary Zeal and Reſolution, fruſtrated by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, but peremptory Orders which he received from Collonel <hi>Lundy.</hi>

                              <p>The Commonalty at <hi>Colerain</hi> ſuſpected Collonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> and when he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Bridge, to view the Town, they imagin'd he was going away, and drew up the Bridge, and the Guard preſented their Muskets and Pikes at him.</p>

                              <p>Mr. <hi>Skeffington</hi>'s Regiment was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Ballaghy Dawſons</hi> Bridge, and the Paſſes on the <hi>Band</hi> above <hi>Port-Glenon:</hi> One Battalion of that Regiment, under the Command of Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Houſton,</hi> was ordered to keep the Paſs at <hi>Toam;</hi> but becauſe of the floods which overſpread the Woods of <hi>Creagh,</hi> they could ſeldom get to their Poſts, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Guards: The other part of it under the Command of Major <hi>Michelburn,</hi> was ſent to guard the Paſs at <hi>Newferry,</hi> 4 or 5 miles below <hi>Toam,</hi> to which there was eaſier acceſs. Collonel <hi>Edmonston</hi> was ordered to defend and ſecure the paſs of Port <hi>Glenon,</hi> by hindering the Enemys repairing the Bridge, which is 14 Miles from <hi>Colerain.</hi>

                              <p>Collonel <hi>Canning</hi>'s Regiment was alſo ordered to <hi>Maherafelt,</hi> and <hi>Monimore,</hi> Sir <hi>John Mac Gills</hi> was ſent to <hi>Killrea,</hi> and that part of the <hi>Ban;</hi> care had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before to ſink moſt of the Boats and Cotts on the <hi>Ban</hi> River. Sir <hi>Triſtram Berisford</hi>'s Regiment, with Collonel <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Hamilton</hi>'s, and ſeveral Detachments, to the number of 3000 Men, were left to defend <hi>Colerain.</hi> The Proteſtants at <hi>Fagivie,</hi> under Command of Captain <hi>Blair,</hi> beat back ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> who had croſs'd the River there.</p>

Collonel <hi>Edmonſton</hi> ſent word to Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden,</hi> that his Men were almoſt ſtarved, for want of Proviſions, and that none could be had, unleſs he would furniſh him, and withal deſired to ſee him; and accordingly he ſent Proviſions, and went there late that Night, (<hi>Fryday</hi> 5th.) and found that he had Intrenched himſelf ſo well, that the Enemy could not annoy them, neither with great nor ſmall ſhot, and he had deſtroyed great part of the Bridge; there was a contnual fireing on both ſides.</p>

                              <p>About two a Clock this Morning we had notice, That the Lord <hi>Galmoy,</hi> Coll. <hi>Gordon O Neal,</hi> and Coll. <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> were come to <hi>Dungannon,</hi> with 3000 Foot, and 1000 Horſe, in order to ſurprize and cut off the Garriſon at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimore,</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haſten thither, the Letter being communicated to the Officers, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> ſhould go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Monimore;</hi> but he with Major <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> Capt. <hi>Hugh Mac Gill,</hi> and Captain <hi>Dumbar</hi> had not rode above a mile before they had an Account ſent 'em, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in five or ſix great Boats, had in the Night-time paſſed by the Guards that were kept on the River-ſide, by Coll. <hi>Skeffingtons</hi> Regiment, and were then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down within a mile of Collonel <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſton</hi>'s Trenches: Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> immediately ſent notice of it to Collonel <hi>Edmonston,</hi> to Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and to Major <hi>Michelburn.</hi> One Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Collonel <hi>Edminſton</hi>'s Regiment, that lodged in ſome Countrey houſes, got to the River, and fired at them, till their Powder was all ſpent. When the Boats came within half a Mile of the Trenches, they landed the Men, and took in more <hi>Iriſh</hi> on the other ſide the River, till they had landed a conſiderable Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Two or three Companies of the Granadeers advanced firſt thro the Bogg, towards Collonel <hi>Edmonſton</hi>'s Trenches; he having but 120 Men in 'em, went out with 60 of them to line a Ditch on the ſide of the Bogg towards the Enemy, (leaving Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Will. Shaw</hi> to guard the Trenches,) and vigorouſly oppoſed 'em till both their Ammunition was ſpent, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> overpowered
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99417:15"/>'em with their numbers, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually increaſing. About this time Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> and Captain <hi>Dunbar</hi> came to the Trenches; and were ſurprized with a Volley of ſhot from the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent 100 Granadeers to line the Hedges, on the way to that only paſs by which they could retreat, and to keep that paſs againſt a party of Proteſtants that they ſaw marching towards it. This par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was five Companies of Foot, under Command of Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Whitney,</hi> coming to Collonel <hi>Edmonſton</hi>'s aſſiſtance, who Commanded three young Captains to lead on the men; but when he obſerved the Enemy, he Commanded his men to face about and retire, which all did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one Captain <hi>James Mac-Gill,</hi> who aſhamed of ſo baſe a retreat went on: About this time, Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden,</hi> and Captain <hi>Dumbar</hi> came to the paſs, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other way to eſcape, ventured through all the ſhot, powr'd in upon 'em from the Hedges till they met Captain <hi>James Mac-Gill,</hi> but as they were charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again, they ſpied another party of <hi>Iriſh</hi> behind 'em, and they had not gone far before Captain <hi>James Mac-Gill</hi> was unfortunately ſhot off his Horſe: A Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Granadeers came up and run his Sword ſeveral times through him, and another of 'em daſhed out his brains with a Muſquet; (ſo barbarouſly did they kill that deſerving young Gentleman, whoſe early Valour would have met with other treatment from any Enemy but the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>) By that time Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> had got over the paſs, Major <hi>Baker</hi> and Captain <hi>Hugh Mac-Gill</hi> were come up with what men they could get together, and had ſtop'd Collonel <hi>Whitney</hi>'s party. Collonel <hi>Edmonſton</hi> alſo, and Lieut. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Shaw</hi> had by ſeveral ways got up to them; but the Soldiers having little Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition or Match left, the body of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being increaſed, and eſpecially the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi>'s March towards <hi>Monymore</hi> being confirmed, it was reſolved that Collonel <hi>Edmonſton,</hi> and Lieutenant Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Whitney,</hi> ſhou'd March to <hi>Colerain:</hi> That Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> with his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Dragoons, Collonel <hi>Skeffing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Kennings</hi> Regiments of Foot, (the laſt of them was under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Lieutenant Collonel <hi>William Cuningham,</hi>) ſhould March towards <hi>Derry,</hi> which was accordingly done.</p>

            <p>Beſides Captain <hi>James Mac-Gill,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral common Soldiers which were loſt, one Captain <hi>Henly</hi> was wounded and taken Priſoner. And Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fatigue and want of reſt caſt himſelf into a dangerous Illneſs, which afterwards forced him to leave that Kingdom. A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who in all thoſe affairs of the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhewed himſelf a true lover and friend of his Country, by his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Zeal and Courage; his great Expences and indefatigable diligence in the defence of it. Collonel <hi>Edmonſton</hi> alſo contracted thoſe Diſtempers in the Trenches at <hi>Port-Glenon,</hi> of which he afterwards died at <hi>Cull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, April</hi> the 14th. having behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there, and on all other occaſions with great Gallantry and Reſolution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> having croſſed the <hi>Ban,</hi> all thoſe of the Army above at <hi>Monymore</hi> and <hi>Maghrifelt,</hi> (except a few Captains that took Protection) as well as thoſe of <hi>Toam,</hi> and <hi>Newferry,</hi> fled over the Mountains to <hi>Derry. Colerain</hi> was deſerted leaſt the Iriſh ſhould intercept betwixt the Forces there, and thoſe at <hi>Derry;</hi> part of the Bridge was cut down, part of it Burnt. And all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey came towards <hi>Derry</hi> as their laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the 9th. the Body of our Army came to the Ferry that leads over to the Town, and it was no ſmall trouble to ſee ſo many brave and reſolute men both Horſe and Foot without a General. The Horſe and Dragoons were that day ordered by Collonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> to March to <hi>Lifford</hi> and <hi>Strabane,</hi> and the next the Dragoons were ordered to March to <hi>Letter-Kenny:</hi> The Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons brought in good ſtore of Meale and other Proviſions to <hi>Derry.</hi>

               <hi>April</hi> 10th. Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi> being ſent from <hi>England,</hi> with Inſtructions and a Letter from the King to Collonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> came this day to <hi>Derry;</hi> he met ſome Officers, and a great number of people going off: Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> had offered Paſſes to the Officers, and ſpoke ſo diſcouragingly to many of them, concerning the indefenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the place, that they ſtrongly ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted he had a deſign to give it up; and they could ſee little hope of preventing it, in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99417:16"/>ſuch a Confuſion if he proved Treacherous, and therefore were unwilling to ſtay, only to be betrayed into the Enemies hands. Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi> delivered the Kings Letter to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour <hi>Lundy,</hi> and acquainted him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with the cauſe of his coming, and the Forces following him at Sea for their aid; and though this good News put new Life and reſolution into many of them, yet ſince others, and particularly ſome of the chief Officers were ſaid to be on the Wing to depart; he was earneſt with Governour <hi>Lundy</hi> to take ſome ſpeedy and effectual care to prevent it; whereupon a Council of War was held that Night, to whom Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Lundy</hi> imparted his Letter. [ſee it in the end.] Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi>'s Inſtructions were alſo read, and be purſuant thereto, repreſented to 'em his Majeſties great care and concern for 'em, and that whole Kingdom; the great preparations making in <hi>England</hi> for their relief, and the Forces at preſent haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to 'em. He therefore earneſtly diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 'em from deſerting the place, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to his Inſtructions a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account of the preſent Condition of the City as to Men, Arms, Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This had that effect, that the Council drew up the following reſolution, which Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>James Hamilton</hi> propoſed, and was active to promote.</p>

            <p>This Reſolution was not only affixt on the Market-Houſe, but read next Morning at head of every Battallion, at which the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers expreſſed their great ſatisfaction with loud Acclamations and Huzza's.

            <p>At this Councel Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> was choſen to be Commander in chief in the Field, which he undertook. This day Major <hi>Stroud</hi> made ſome Propoſals to Governour <hi>Lundy,</hi> of which no notice was taken; moſt of the Suburbs on both ſides the Water were burnt or pulled down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the 14th. the body of the Enemies Army Marched up towards <hi>Strabane,</hi> part of them within view of the City, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi> went twice to Governour <hi>Lundy,</hi> preſſing him to take ſome ſpeedy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual care for ſecuring the Paſſes of <hi>Fin-Water,</hi> leaſt the Enemy ſhould get over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our men could meet: he replied in a careleſs manner, that he had given Orders already, but how little was actually done towards the prevention of it, the next day gave us a ſad Demonſtration. The ſame day ſeveral others ſent word to Governour <hi>Lundy,</hi> that if he did not March the men that day, the Enemy would certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their getting together in any orderly body, and therefore intreated him to be with the men that Night at <hi>Clady</hi> and <hi>Lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> But their advice was not regarded. our men had burnt all the Corn and Forrage on the Road, ſo that if thoſe Paſſes had been maintained, the Enemies Horſe could not have long ſubſiſted there.</p>
            <p>This day we had News, that a Fleet was ſeen off the Coaſt near the <hi>Lough-mouth,</hi> but were driven off by the Wind to Sea again.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Hamil,</hi> and Major <hi>Crofton</hi> with a party at <hi>Lifford,</hi> did all this Night repulſe the Enemy, (who attempted to come over the <hi>Ford,</hi>) with great reſolution and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, killing as we heard ſeveral of them, with their Cannon and ſmall ſhot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the 15th Collonel <hi>Cuningham,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Richards,</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships and Forces arrived in the <hi>Lough,</hi> they had particular Inſtructions to receive from time to time ſuch Orders as Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> ſhould give them in all things relating to his Majeſties Service; purſuant to which, Collonel <hi>Cuningham</hi> ſent three ſeveral Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to him: By the firſt, (which was from <hi>Green-Caſtle</hi> about Ten in the Morning,) he acquainted him with his coming, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his Orders about Landing the two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments on board; by the ſecond, (from <hi>Red-Caſtle</hi> about Two in the Afternoon,) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome information of their being gone out to fight the Enemy at <hi>Clady,</hi> he wrote the following Letter.</p>

                     <hi>HEaring you have taken the Field, in order to fight the Enemy, I have thought it fit for their Majeſties Service to let you know there are two well diſciplin'd Regiments here on Board, that may joyn you in two days at fartheſt; I am ſure they will be of great uſe in any occaſion, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for the encouragement of Raw men, as I judge moſt of yours are, therefore it is my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that you only ſtop the Paſſes at the Fords of</hi> Finn, <hi>till I can joyn you, and afterwards if giving Battle be neceſſary, you will be in a much better posture for it than before. I must ask your pardon if I am too free in my advice; according the remote proſpect I have of things, this ſeems moſt reaſonable to me; but as their Majeſties have left the whole direction of matters to you, ſo you ſhall find that no man living will more chearfully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey you, than your moſt humble Servant,</hi>

            <p>Having no Anſwer to either, he ſent a third Meſſenger from <hi>Culmore-Caſtle,</hi> about Nine at Night, to deſire his Orders which he was ready to execute, but he received no anſwer from Governour <hi>Lundy</hi> till that Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, of which in its due order.</p>
            <p>This day a conſiderable party of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe, Marched from <hi>Strabane</hi> to <hi>Clady,</hi> ſome of their Foot being there before them, our men had the week before broke down ſome Arches of the Bridge, and had made a Breaſt-work at the end of it. Our Forces
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99417:17"/>at <hi>Derry</hi> Marched about Eight or Nine in the Morning towards <hi>Long-Cauſey, Lifford,</hi> and <hi>Clady;</hi> many Troops and Companies were gathering from ſeveral parts to joyn them, in all above 10000. A party of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that attempted to Ford the River at <hi>Caſtle-Fin,</hi> was repulſed by a party of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Skeffingtons</hi> Regiment poſted there: Another ſmall party of our men, about 30 Dragoons of Collonel <hi>Stewarts</hi> Regiment, Commanded by Captain <hi>Murray,</hi> (after moſt of the few Foot poſted there were beat off,) oppoſed the Enemies coming over at <hi>Cladyford,</hi> till all their Ammunition was ſpent. But there was no more Ammunition ſent them; (nay ſo ſtrangely had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour managed things, that moſt part of the Ammunition was but coming from <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> about three or four Miles out of it, when ſome part of our Forces were fleeing thither upon their retreat:) And Major <hi>Stroud</hi> who had ſome Horſe near the Ford was ſo ill plac't, that he could not bring them on, where they were ſo expoſed to the Enemies ſhot, thô he earneſtly endeavour'd it; ſo that they were forc't to retire from the Bridge, the Enemy perceiving this, and obſerving the ſcatter'd condition of our men, ſeveral Troops of their Horſe ruſh't into the River, and ſwam through; (one Major <hi>Nangle</hi> and another Officer were drown'd.) When they got over, they were (as <hi>Gordon O-Neal</hi> ſince told me,) in terrible fear leaſt we ſhould have fallen upon them, for the Waters being high, they had ſcarce a dry ſhot left: But Governour <hi>Lundy,</hi> was ſo far from putting the Proteſtant Forces into any poſture to oppoſe them, that upon notice of their entring the Ford, he gave Orders to all thereabouts, to flee to <hi>Derry,</hi> himſelf leading the way, but ſent none to other parts of the Army, which never met in any conſiderable body. Upon this News of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe being got over, the Foot poſted at <hi>Lifford,</hi> that were ſhooting at a Party of <hi>Iriſh</hi> croſs the River at <hi>Strabane,</hi> were called off, and retired to the Paſs at <hi>Long Cauſey.</hi> Collonel <hi>Franc. Hamilton</hi> ſtopt thoſe that fled there, and drew 'em up in good order behind that Paſs, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would take that way, and <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> would come thither from <hi>Rapho:</hi> But the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe chiefly purſued thoſe that took the way to <hi>Rapho,</hi> where they did great Execution on Coll. <hi>Mountgomery</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Foot, there being no tolerable care taken to bring 'em off. And they had been all cut off, if they had not got into Boggs, and Mariſhy places, to ſecure themſelves from the Enemies Horſe. The Forces at the <hi>Long Cauſey</hi> ſtaid there till towards even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but fearing the Enemy might come from <hi>Rapho,</hi> to intercept their paſſage to <hi>Derry,</hi> they retired thither: So inexcuſable was the Conduct of the General, both in abandoning ſo many Paſſes, and thoſe ſo eaſily defenſible by a few men, if they had been either ſupplyed with Ammunition, or conſtantly reliev'd, and in never ſo much as attempting to draw the Forces into a Body, when there were in the Field above 10000 men, who (whatever he pretended to the contrary) wanted more <hi>care</hi> and <hi>reſolution</hi> in their Leader than Courage in themſelves: But whether this ill Conduct muſt be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd to <hi>negligence</hi> or <hi>deſign,</hi> the Reader muſt be left to judge by his following actions.</p>
            <p>Governour <hi>Lundy</hi> being come into Town, order'd the Centinels to ſhut the Gates, ſo that many Officers, Soldiers and private Gentlemen were forc'd that Night to lye about the Walls; and the reaſon that he ſince publickly gave for it, is not unworthy the Readers notice, <hi>viz. To preſerve the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, which he knew to be ſufficient for</hi> 3000 <hi>men for</hi> 3 <hi>Months, after the rate of</hi> 4 <hi>pounds of Fiſh,</hi> 3 <hi>pounds of Fleſh, and</hi> 8 <hi>quarts of Meal per Week, for each Man.</hi> And though this was very far from being a juſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connt, yet how very different a one he gave the Officers of the two Regiments on board, will appear by what follows.</p>
            <p>Governour <hi>Lundy</hi> this Night ſent back Major <hi>Tiffin,</hi> Captain <hi>Lyndon,</hi> and Captain <hi>Cornwall</hi> Commander of the <hi>Swallow Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat</hi> (as appears by a Certificate annext at the end) with the following Anſwer to Coll. <hi>Cuningham</hi>'s Meſſage.</p>

            <p>The two Collonels with their Officers were intire ſtrangers to the State of the Town, and the reſt were in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unacquainted with it; for Coll. <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> had call'd none of the Inhabitants to it except Mr. <hi>Mogredge</hi> the Clark; and when, ſeveral of the principal Officers (who had ſome ſuſpicion of Coll. <hi>Lundy</hi>'s deſign) as Coll. <hi>Franc. Hamilton,</hi> Coll. <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> Coll. <hi>Crofton,</hi> Lieut. Coll. <hi>Ponſonby,</hi> &amp;c. deſired to be admitted, they were abſolutely refuſed, though at the ſame Council he pretended he had ſent for the two firſt, but ſaid they could not be found, and for Sir <hi>Arthur Rew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who he ſaid was a dying.</p>
            <p>Coll <hi>Cuningham</hi> deliver'd to Governor <hi>Lundy</hi> his Majeſties Letter and Orders di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to him; but the Governour, who was Preſident of the Council, gave 'em the ſame account of the State of the Town that he had before given to Major <hi>Tiffin,</hi> and therefore adviſed 'em all to quit it, for he ſaid he would do ſo himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the Council who came from <hi>England,</hi> thinking it impoſſible the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhould be ignorant of the Condition of the Town, and obſerving the account to paſs without any contradiction from thoſe there who had been for ſome time in it, but had not it ſeems inform'd themſelves better; ſoon agreed in the Opinion of returning for <hi>England,</hi> rather than ſtay in a place not to be Victualled from the Countrey, eſpecially when as he further ſaid the Enemy were near their Gates with 25000 Men; and there was no poſſibility of a return from <hi>England</hi> in ſo ſhort a time as the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour affirm'd what Proviſion they had muſt be ſpent, (only Coll. <hi>Richards</hi> argued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, becauſe he look'd on the deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Garriſon not only as the quitting that City, but the whole Kingdom,) and accordingly they came to the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Upon Enquiry it appears, that there is not Proviſion in the Garriſon of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-Derry</hi> for the preſent Garriſon, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99417:18"/>the two Regiments on board, for above a week, or ten days at moſt: and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing that the Place is not tenable againſt a well appointed Army, therefore it is concluded upon, and reſolved, That it is not convenient for his Majeſties Service, but the contrary, to land the two Regiments under Col. <hi>Cunningham,</hi> and Col. <hi>Richards,</hi> their Command, now on board in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Lough-foyle:</hi> That conſidering the preſent circumſtances of Affairs, and the likelihood the Enemy will ſoon poſſeſs themſelves of this Place, it is thought moſt convenient, that the Principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſhall privately withdraw themſelves, as well for their own preſervation, as in hopes that the Inhabitants by a timely Capitulation may make terms the better with the Enemy; and that this we judge moſt convenient for his Majeſties Service, as the preſent State of Affairs now is.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On the Reſult of this Council, Collonel <hi>Cunningham,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Richards,</hi> with their Officers, went down to the Ships, which that day fell down below <hi>Red-Caſtle:</hi> But Collonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> to delude both the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Soldiers in Town (who were earneſtly begging, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces might land, that with their Aſſiſtance they might take the Field, and fight the Enemy, before their Cannon were brought over, in order to the Preſervation of that corner, into which the Proviſions and Wealth of 3 or 4 Counties was crouded) told 'em pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, <hi>It was reſolved the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Forces ſhould immediately land, and when they were in their Quarters, the Gates ſhould be opened, and all joyn in defence of the Town:</hi> And to cloak the Intreague the better, the Sheriffs were ordered to go through the City, to provide Quarters for 'em, who according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did ſo. But all this was meer ſham to amuſe the Town, while they might get away with the greater Eaſe and Safety: This Order was not publickly known till the 18th. But one of the Officers of this Council acquainted Collonel <hi>Franc. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Hugh Mac Gill</hi> with it, and adviſed 'em to go off. Captain <hi>Mac Gill</hi> diſcovered it to ſeveral Friends, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden,</hi> (who then lay extreamly weak, and was the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there by Name excepted from Mercy in the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Proclamation.) This made 'em look on the Town as betrayed, and repreſented affairs ſo deſperate to 'em, that they thought it madneſs in 'em to ſtay behind, meerly to be expoſed as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Fury of the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many of 'em got off to the Ships the day following.</p>
            <p>This Day the Body of our Foot that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, by command from <hi>Clady,</hi> and thoſe parts, came in tolerable Order to the Gates, but were ſurprized to find 'em ſhut, by the Governours Order, who had but the Day before commanded 'em to flee thither; they called to the Centries to open 'em, which they refuſed: But when one of the Captains of Collonel <hi>Skeffingtons</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fired at the Centry, and call'd for Fire to burn the Gate, that and the other Gates were thrown open, and all that had been kept out the Night before, now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Town, which made a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Body.</p>
            <p>There being no Forrage in the Town, the Horſe went all generally towards <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> ſome both Officers and Souldiers, who had obſerved Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi>'s ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and the confuſed Poſture their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were in, got to the Ships; thoſe that ſtayed, gathered to Captain <hi>Murray,</hi> and reſolved to ſell their lives dear, rather than fall into the hands of an Enemy, from whom they expected no Mercy.</p>
            <p>Governour <hi>Lundy</hi> had plac'd Captain <hi>Jemmet</hi> Governour of <hi>Culmore,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by his Order deſerted it, though he had been formerly active in the ſervice of the Town; a few <hi>Iriſh</hi> poffeſt themſelves of it, but it was ſoon recovered by a ſmall Artifice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 17th. King <hi>James</hi> and his Army being advanc'd as far as St. <hi>Johnſtown,</hi> (five miles from <hi>Derry,</hi>) he, or Lieutenant Gen. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> ſends one Mr. <hi>Whitlow,</hi> a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman, to Governour <hi>Lundy,</hi> to know if they in the City would ſurrender on ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable terms, which they ſhould have to prevent the effuſion of Chriſtian Blood: On this a Council was held, who conclude to ſend to King <hi>James,</hi> to know what his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Demands were, and what terms he would grant to the City: The Meſſenger himſelf being allowed to ſit and joyn in Debates with them. The ſame Gentleman had on the 16th. told Cornet <hi>Nicholſen</hi> (his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99417:18"/>old Acquaintance) who inquired of him what Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> intended, That the Town would be delivered up before Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following, and therefore adviſed him to ſhift for himſelf. He ſaid the ſame to to Mr. <hi>Henry Nicholſon,</hi> Arch-deacon <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Captain <hi>Kinaſton,</hi> and Captain <hi>Nevil</hi> were ſent; who had acceſs to the King, and returned that Night, but were refuſed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance by the Multitude. Only the two former ſome way got in; the laſt (who had before been very active) wrote in a Letter the Account of their Negotiation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>A little before this time Mr. <hi>Will. Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and Enſign <hi>Twinyo</hi> came to Town, ſent (as was reported, and confirmed by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted Letter) by King <hi>James</hi> from <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemount,</hi> to amuſe the Garriſon with ſuch accounts of the Clemency of the King on the one hand, and the formidable ſtrength of his Army on the other, as might incline them to a ſurrender. This Diſcourſe ſoon expoſed them to the ſuſpition of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, who ſeized and put them under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. <hi>Blacker,</hi> while thus confined, writes a Letter to the Camp (which was intercepted) to this purpoſe: <hi>That he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not they knew he was detained a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in Town, but he ſerved their Interest as much there as if he were in their Camp: They had many Friends in Town, eſpecially Captain</hi> Darcy, <hi>Mr.</hi> White, <hi>(Collector of Strabane,)</hi> &amp;c. There was a Council held upon them, but after ſome time they were both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt.</p>
            <p>The common Soldiers, who knew nothing of the forementioned Order of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, were ſo enraged at their Officers, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of whom (as was before hinted) about this time left them and fled for <hi>England,</hi> that they could not forbear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing it with ſome violence on ſome of them. One Captain <hi>Bell</hi> was ſhot dead, and another Officer hurt, who had (as was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with that Deſign) got into a Boat with ſeveral other Officers.</p>
            <p>This Day ſome in the Town ſent one Captain <hi>Cole</hi> to Coll. <hi>Cunningham,</hi> to offer him the Government of it, becauſe they ſuſpected Coll. <hi>Lundy</hi>'s Integrity. Coll. <hi>Cunningham</hi>'s Anſwer was, <hi>That he being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to apply himſelf to Coll.</hi> Lundy <hi>for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in all things relating to their Majeſties Service, could receive no Application from any that oppoſed that Authority.</hi> On the 18th. the Ships fell down to <hi>Green-Caſtle,</hi> and on the 19th. ſailed for <hi>England.</hi> On the 20th. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one a clock in the Morning, a Ship ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king towards the Coaſt from whence they came, enquired whether they had met the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet; upon which Coll. <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham</hi> hoping that ſome part of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Fleet might be near, from whom they might have Proviſions, reſolved if he could procure from them Proviſions for one Fortnight, to return to <hi>Derry.</hi> Upon which they gave the ſignal, and made after that Ship, but found it to be the <hi>Bonadventure</hi> Frigat, that was convoying ſome Ships with Arms and Ammunition to <hi>Derry,</hi> but no Proviſions. This Account I had from Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden,</hi> and Captain <hi>Hugh Mac Gill,</hi> who were then on board the ſame Veſſel. There was none of the Veſſels, but only that wherein Collonel <hi>Richards</hi> was, that took the ſignal, and made after the <hi>Bonadventure</hi> Frigat.</p>
            <p>This Night Major <hi>Crofion</hi> finding the Gates open, and two of the Keys wanting, doubled the Guards, and changed the word. He was queſtioned for it the next day by Coll. <hi>Lundy;</hi> but he thought not fit to infiſt on it, and ſo there was no more made of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 18th. What ſecret Aſſurances were given King <hi>James,</hi> that firſt induc'd him to march his Army down to the City, or to retire again, in expectation of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes being brought to a complyance, thoſe can give the beſt Account that were moſt active for a ſurrender, and privy to all the clandeſtine tranſactions about it. But 'tis certain, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army came this day to the Strand above the <hi>Windmill,</hi> at the South end of <hi>Derry</hi> hill, and there ſtop'd, waiting what Anſwer or Salutation the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would give them. The Council had it the mean time given ſtrict Orders that none offer to fire from the Walls on ſevere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, and ſome were ſent about the Walls to give intimation of it. But how little the Council or their Orders were valued by the Soldiers, the event ſoon ſhew'd. It was at this Council that Mr. <hi>John Mogredg,</hi> who had been Clerk to the forementioned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, held by Collonel <hi>Lundy,</hi> Collonel <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi> &amp;c. declared he would conceal no longer the Reſult of that Council, <hi>[viz. That
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99417:19"/>Collonel</hi> Cunningham <hi>ſhould return with the two Regiments, and all Gentlemen and Officers quitt the Garriſon, and go with him.]</hi> He deſired Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour <hi>Lundy</hi> to produce the Order, which was a great ſurprize to this preſent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who (tho they generally agreed too well with Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> about ſurrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) yet deeply reſented the concealing ſo material a thing from them.</p>
            <p>But our Men on the Walls paid ſo little Deference to either them or their Orders, and ſo little regarded the ſecret Treaties they were managing with the Enemy, that when King <hi>James</hi>'s Forces were advancing towards them on the <hi>Strand,</hi> they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fired their great Guns at them, and (as was confidently reported) kill'd one Captain <hi>Troy,</hi> near the Kings Perſon. This unnexpected Salutation not only ſtruck a ſtrange Terror into the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Camp, but put the King himſelf into ſome diſorder, to find himſelf ſo roughly and unmannerly treated by thoſe, from whom he expected ſo dutiful a Compliance. And thoſe who had encouraged him to try an Experiment that proved ſo dangerous, thought themſelves concern'd to make ſome Apology for it. The Council therefore reſolved to ſend <hi>Arch-deacon Hamilton</hi> to the King, to excuſe themſelves for what had paſs'd, and lay all the blame of it on the ungovernableneſs of the People, whoſe violent humour, they ſaid they could not reſtrain, while his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my continued there, and therefore begg'd his patience, till the preſent tumult was over: And becauſe ſome of the Council, as well as others, could hardly believe that King <hi>James</hi> was really there, Captain <hi>White</hi> was ſent with the Arch-deacon (having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeen the King) to put them out of all doubt about it. Captain <hi>White</hi> returned to them with aſſurance of it, but Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con <hi>Hamilton</hi> took Protection, (that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer he ſickned and died.) But King <hi>James</hi>'s being there, was an Argument that had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle force on our Men on the Walls, who were reſolv'd to defend the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and King <hi>Williams</hi> Intereſt, againſt him and his Army to the utmoſt. Nay, they now began to be impatient, to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thus betrayed by ſuch as ſhould have been their Leaders, and ſeverely threatned both the Governour and his Council, for tampering with the Enemy.</p>
            <p>The Governour and Council, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſpleas'd at the boldneſs and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Soldiers, could not help it, having loſt all Authority and Credit with them, of which this day produc'd a new Inſtance, as conſiderable as this. Capt. <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> was advanc'd from <hi>Culmere</hi> Fort to the green Field below <hi>Penny-burn-Mill,</hi> with a conſiderable Party of Horſe, within view of the Town, having left 1500 Foot below at <hi>Brook-hall.</hi> It was his appearing there had encouraged the Men on the Walls to accoſt the Iriſh Army ſo rudely. The Governour and Council perceiving his Motion towards the City, diſpatch'd one <hi>Murray</hi> an Expreſs to him, with a Line to this purport, <hi>That he ſhould immediately upon ſight thereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw with his Men to the back of the Hill, out of the View of the City.</hi> He underſtood not the meaning of ſo ſtrange an Order; but the Meſſenger being his Relation, explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Myſtery to him; that the Governour and his Council were about making Terms with the Enemy for ſurrendring the Town; and added, that ſeveral of his Friends advis'd him to haſten to Town, if he defign'd to make any effectual oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Enemy; for if he came not, the Town would certainly be delivered into the their hands: Upon which he reſolves to March with his Horſe ſtraight to the City, where, with ſome difficulty from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Dragoons, who fired at him in the way, he came to <hi>Ship-key-gate;</hi> Mr. <hi>Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> was ſent from the Council to diſcourſe him, who would have had him alone to be taken up on the Walls by a Rope, which he refuſed with diſdain; but Mr. <hi>James Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,</hi> Captain of the Guards, without any Orders, opened the Gates to him and his Troops. His Preſence, when he came, ſtruck a cold damp on the Governour and his Council, but inſpir'd the Men on the Walls with Vigour and Reſolution.</p>
            <p>This ſame Council this day proceeded to conclude a Surrender, and drew up a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that purpoſe, which moſt of them Signed, and as far as I could ever learn, all of them, (though many of the Signers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards heartily joined with us in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Place.)</p>
            <p>But to return to Capt. <hi>Murray,</hi> the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude having eagerly deſir'd and expected his coming, followed him through the ſtreets
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99417:19"/>with great expreſſions of their Reſpect and Affection. He aſſur'd them he would ſtand by them in defence of their Lives and the Proteſtant Intereſt, and aſſiſt them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to ſuppreſs <hi>Lundy</hi> and his Council, to prevent their Deſign of ſurrendring the City; deſiring all who would concurr with him herein, to put a <hi>White Cloath</hi> on their left Arm, which they generally did, being alſo encourag'd to it by Capt. <hi>Baſhford,</hi> Capt. <hi>Noble,</hi> and others. This greatly alarm'd and perplex'd the Governour and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: They conclude to ſend for him, and try if they can prevail with him to ſign the Paper for ſurrendring the City: At their Invitation he comes into the Council, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſome Friends, (though diſſuaded by others.) What paſs'd betwixt him and Governour <hi>Lundy</hi> being of ſome importance to the right underſtanding that ſtrange Turn of Affairs, on which the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of that City depended, I ſhall give the Reader this ſhort account of it. Col. <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> deſir'd to know the occaſion of his Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies of him: Capt. <hi>Murray</hi> told him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his late Actions had declar'd him either <hi>Fool.</hi> or <hi>Knave;</hi> and to make this charge good, he inſiſted on his groſs neglect to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Paſſes at <hi>Strabane, Lifford</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> refuſing Ammunition when ſent for, riding away from an Army of 10 or 12000 Men, able and willing to have encounter'd the Enemy, neglecting the advantageous Paſſes of <hi>Long-cauſey</hi> and <hi>Carickins,</hi> which a few Men might have defended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He urg'd him to take the Field, and fight the Enemy, aſſuring him of the readineſs of the Soldiers, whom he Vindlcated from thoſe Aſperſions of Cowardiſe which Coll. <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> caſt on 'em; and when Coll. <hi>Lundy</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to joyn with the Gent. there preſent, who had Sign'd a Paper for ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring the Town, and offer'd ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to that purpoſe, drawn from their Danger; he abſolutely refuſed it, unleſs it were agreed on in a general Council of the Officers, which he alledg'd that could not be, ſince there were as many abſent as preſent.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe being ended, The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Council go on with their Deſign of ſurrendring. Capt. <hi>Murray</hi> leaves them, and returns to the Soldiers that waited for him: He obſerved that the Council were reſolved to give up the City, which if they ſhould do, it was impoſſible for him to keep <hi>Culmore;</hi> and having adviſed with his Friends, he reſolves to ſtay in Town, and do his utmoſt to prevent what he ſaw the Councel intended; to which he was the more encouraged, by the entire intereſt he had in the affections of the common Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whom he knew to be generally as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to a Surrender, and as reſolute for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the City as himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Council goes on, after the Paper for Surrender was ſubſcribed, to conſider what methods were fit to be taken for capitulating with the King. They agree to ſend out 20 Men to him for that end, as the King by a Meſſenger had propoſed. But the men were not choſen this Night; but before the Council was diſmiſt, Governour <hi>Lundy</hi> ſent for ſome of the <hi>N. C.</hi> Miniſters to come to the Council; none of them went, but one who refuſed to ſit. The reaſons of their being ſent for, were partly to engage them to perſuade Captain <hi>Murray,</hi> to comply with the reſt for Surrendring: partly that their appearance there to countenance thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Council might induce the multitude to comply alſo, who were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of that perſuaſion; but they not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, this project fail'd, and this prov'd the laſt Seſſion of the Council.</p>
            <p>That theſe pernicious intentions of the Council, might be the more effectually counteracted, Captain <hi>Murray</hi> and a party with him went this Night to the Main-Guard, took the Keys from one Captain <hi>Wigston,</hi> who then Commanded the Guard, and appointed Guards that Night at the Gates, and on the Walls.</p>
            <p>The Soldiers and Multitude thus headed by Captain <hi>Murray,</hi> renew their threats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Governour and his Council, who were ſo juſtly apprehenſive of their danger from them, that after that time Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> kept his Chamber till he ſtole away, and few of his Council durſt for a while appear in the ſtreets, for fear of the armed Multitude.</p>
            <p>I have inſiſted the more largely on the Tranſactions of this day, betwixt Captain <hi>Murray,</hi> and the Governour in Council, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the oppoſition he made to their deſign, both in the Council, and eſpecially by his influence on the Multitude, was the only
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99417:20"/>thing that prevented the ſurrender of the City to King <hi>James,</hi> and altered the whole ſcene of affairs in it. And I muſt in Juſtice add, that though the body of thoſe that joyned with him were call'd the Rabble, yet they were generally men as Eminent for their great Probity, as for their Courage, acted with a hearty zeal to the Proteſtant Religion, and animated with the hopes of ſeeing it ere long flouriſh in that Kingdom, under the happy Government of King <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iam</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> And how much the main ſtreſs of the defence of that City lay on them, will appear in the following account of it.</p>
            <p>This Evening King <hi>James</hi> with his Army went back to St. <hi>Johnſtown,</hi> and ſtayed there till the 20th. waiting for an anſwer from the City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the 19th. the Multitude having thus broken the Authority of the Council, would have made Captain <hi>Murray</hi> both their General, and the ſole Governour of the Town; but he modeſtly refuſed it, becauſe he judged himſelf fitter for Action and Service in the Field, than for Conduct or Government in the Town. And therefore when ſeveral Gentlemen invited him to a Council, that they might chooſe a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he very readily agreed to it. At this Council, there were at firſt but about 15 in all, where all the Officers of the Garriſon ought to have been, as matters then ſtood. The perſons nominated were Major <hi>Henry Baker,</hi> Major <hi>Mitchelburn,</hi> and Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Richard Johnſton:</hi> Major <hi>Baker</hi> had the Majority of Votes, and was choſen their Governour. Having done this, they immediately conſidered what Regiments might be in Town, and concluded on 8.</p>
            <p>Governour <hi>Baker</hi> to be Collonel to Sir <hi>Arthur Rawdens</hi> Dragoons.</p>
            <p>Major <hi>Walker,</hi> to be Collonel to the Lord <hi>Charlemonts</hi> Regiment, the Lieutenant Collonel being gone.</p>
            <p>Major <hi>Parker,</hi> to Command <hi>Colerain</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment.</p>
            <p>Major <hi>Mitchelburn,</hi> to Command Mr. <hi>Skeffingtons</hi> Regiment.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Hamill,</hi> to be Collonel to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Whitney,</hi> to be Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel to <hi>Francis Hamiltons</hi> Regiment.</p>
            <p>Major <hi>Crofton,</hi> to be Collonel to Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Kanning</hi>'s Regiment.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Murray,</hi> to be Collonel to the Horſe.</p>
            <p>This being done, the new choſen Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour made a Speech to acquaint them, <hi>That the work they had now laid on him, was too much for him to diſcharge, and therefore deſired they would allow him an Aſſistant for the Stores and Proviſions:</hi> This he might have done of himſelf, and therefore they readily agreed to the Motion, and deſired him to nominate whom he pleaſed; he named Mr. <hi>George Walker,</hi> to which they aſſented.</p>
            <p>The next thing the Council fell on, (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more being now come into it,) was to proſecute and perfect what <hi>Lundy</hi> had left unfiniſh't the Night before, <hi>viz.</hi> the choice of 20 men to go out and capitulate with King <hi>James.</hi> It was propoſed to Collonel <hi>Murray</hi> to be one of them, but he refuſed and went to the Walls. Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> (who kept his Chamber,) being informed that they had choſen a new Governour, and were proceeding to chooſe the 20 Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, ſends Mr. <hi>Seth Whittle,</hi> Parſon of <hi>Balliachy,</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Hamilton</hi> to the Council, to make all the intereſt they could there to have Friends, (as he called them,) choſen to go to King <hi>James,</hi> which they earneſtly endeavoured. The 20 are choſen, and ready to go out: The multitude on the Walls and at the Gates hearing of it, are ſo inraged, that they threatned, <hi>That if a man of them offered to go out on that Errand, they would treat them as betrayers of the Town, the Proteſtant Religion, and King</hi> Williams <hi>Intereſt.</hi> Upon which none of them durſt offer to go, and ſo a ſtop was put to that dangerous Capitulation, notwithſtanding the orders of the Governour and Council. So little did the Soldiers regard any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that ſeem'd to croſs their reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of defending the City.</p>
            <p>Now the Soldiers, whom their Officers had deſerted, choſe their Captains, and each Captain which of the Collonels he would ſerve under, as they pleaſed themſelves.</p>
            <p>What the number of Men, Women, and Children, in the Town might be is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; ſome of the aged people, Women and Children, with ſome few others, to the number of near a thouſand, left us.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:99417:20"/>
            <p>This Evening a Trumpet comes to the Walls from King <hi>James,</hi> to know why they ſent not out Commiſſioners to treat accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Propoſals. The Multitude ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put a ſtop to that, Collonel <hi>Whitney</hi> wrote a few lines to excuſe themſelves to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the 20th. A party of King <hi>James</hi>'s Horſe and Foot march't down to <hi>Culmore,</hi> and from thence down through the Barony of <hi>Iniſhowen,</hi> and there Rob'd a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people, that were waiting for Paſſage to <hi>Scotland.</hi> They plac't Guards on the Waterſide, to ſtop all paſſage from this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>Culmore</hi> by Land, which debarr'd us of intelligence from that place.</p>
            <p>This day the Lord <hi>Strabare,</hi> came to the Walls with many Propoſals, offering ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable terms to the City, if they would ſurrender. Collonel <hi>Murray</hi> waited on his Lordſhip without the Gate, and diſcourſed long with him.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip earneſtly ſollicited him to come over to their party, offering him a Collonels place in their Army, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds gratuity from the King; But his offers being rejected, he took his leave: Collonel <hi>Murray</hi> conveying him through our out-Guards.</p>
            <p>This Evening a party of our Horſe and Foot, marched out with a deſign to attack the Enemy, but returned upon an informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome deſign againſt them in the Town. About the ſame time Collonel <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> brib'd a Continel, with whom he ſtole away, and going to <hi>Brook-Hall,</hi> which was then in the Enemies power, he wrote from thence a Letter to a Lieutenant in Town, deſiring him to leave the Town, and bring off a Crop-Horſe with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the 21th. The Enemy placed a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miculverin, 180 perches diſtant <hi>E.</hi> by <hi>N.</hi> from the Town on the other ſide of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and begun early this Morning to play upon us, but did little harm, though it was then a little more frightful to our people than afterwards, when they were more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarized to it. This day our men ſallied out both Horſe and Foot towards <hi>Penny-burn Mill,</hi> the Horſe Commanded by Collonel <hi>Murray,</hi> the Foot by ſeveral Captains, <hi>viz.</hi> Captain <hi>Arch. Sanderſon,</hi> Captain <hi>Beatty,</hi> Captain <hi>Thomas Blaire,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>David Blair,</hi> &amp;c. Lieut. Collonel <hi>John Cairns,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Philip Dumbar,</hi> &amp;c. being plac'd on the Hill with a Reſerve. Coll. <hi>Murray</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the Horſe, which were about 300 in number, in two Partys: With the firſt of theſe he charg'd himſelf, with great Courage; the ſecond Squadron was led on by Major <hi>Nathaniel Bull,</hi> Son to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Samuel Bull,</hi> of the County of <hi>Meath;</hi> (who did us very good Service, by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity to the Intereſt of the Garriſon, and his influence on the Souldiers to animate their Courage.) The Rear of that Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron was brought up by Capt. <hi>Cochran,</hi> who when his Squadron fled, advanc'd with a few to the Party that was engaged, his Horſe being ſhot under him, and himſelf ſhot in the Legg. The Enemy divided their Horſe into two Squadrons alſo: He that commanded the firſt Party led them on with great bravery. Coll. <hi>Murray</hi> charg'd through that Brigade, and had that day three Perſonal Encounters with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, in the laſt of which he kill'd him on the ſpot, whom the Enemy themſelves confeſs'd to be Lieut. Gen. <hi>Mammau:</hi> It was alſo reported, that he kill'd his Brother in the ſame Action. In the mean time the Rear of our Horſe fled towards the Walls, the Enemies Horſe being hot in the purſuit of them. Our Foot that were at the <hi>Mill</hi> had done great Execution on the Enemy, but obſerving the Horſe were generally fled, (except a ſmall Party which continued with Coll. <hi>Murray</hi>) they came down to the <hi>Strand</hi>-ſide, and lined the Ditches: And the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horſe that purſued ours having no other way to come back but that, our Men fir'd ſo thick on them at their return, that very few of all that Party eſcap'd. This day when this diſpute was begun, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the Afternoon brought the Cannon they had ply'd us with, down to the Point, oppoſite to our Men on the <hi>Strand,</hi> and play'd over warmly at them, (though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Execution) 'till one of our Guns from the Walls diſabled their Gun, and kill'd the Gunner and others. We could have no certain account how many of the Enemy were kill'd, they were ſaid to be above 200: We loſt 9 or 10, <hi>viz.</hi> Lieut. <hi>Mac Phedris,</hi> Cornet <hi>Brown,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mackee,</hi> one <hi>Harkneſs,</hi> and 5 or 6 more private Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; ſeveral were wounded. We got on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one Standard, but conſiderable ſpoil of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99417:21"/>Horſe, Arms, Cloaks, Saddles, Watches, Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Prey did not a little quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Appetites, and animate the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the Soldiers in their Sallies after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; the manner whereof (to ſuggeſt that here) was uſually this, That when any Officer of note, with a few more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him was about to go out, all that were willing to hazard themſelves in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize followed them as Volunteers.</p>
            <p>The Perſons of note ſaid to be kill'd on the Enemys ſide, were, General <hi>Mammau,</hi> Major <hi>Taaff,</hi> Major <hi>Waggon,</hi> Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Puſignian,</hi> Quarter-Maſter <hi>Caſſore,</hi> Capt. <hi>Fitzgerald.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 23. The Enemy planted two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons in the lower end of <hi>Strong</hi>'s Orchard, near 80 Perches diſtant from the Town, on the other ſide the Water, over againſt <hi>Ship-key-ſtreet;</hi> theſe threw Ball of about ten pound weight each; with theſe they play'd ſo inceſſantly on that ſtreet, piercing the Garrets and Walls, that ſome were hurt, and few durſt ſtay above ſtairs. The Beſieged having made a Blind in that ſtreet to preſerve the People, repay them from the Walls in the ſame coyn, and kill'd Lieut. <hi>Fitz-patrick,</hi> Lieut. <hi>Con Oneal,</hi> 2 Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, ſome Soldiers, and (as was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) 2 luſty Friars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 25. Collonel <hi>Murray,</hi> with ſome Horſe, and a good Party of Foot, ſally out and beat the Beſiegers that had got into the Ditches out of them. Some few of our Foot had purſued too far: A Party of the Enemies Horſe coming ſuddenly about the end of the little Hill, forc'd 'em to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire back to the reſt of our Party, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Enemies Horſe to advance ſo quick towards them, took themſelves to the Ditch by the way ſide, and fired ſo briskly and continually on them, that they were forc'd to flee. Our men purſue them down to <hi>Penny-burn-mill,</hi> and preſs'd ſo hard upon them, that their Dragoons (who were beat from the <hi>old Mill,</hi> near an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Mile up the ſame water that <hi>Penny-burn-mill</hi> ſtands on) left their Horſes, and came down to aſſiſt their Foot and ſome Horſe who were in hazard at <hi>Penny-burn-mill.</hi> Our Men kept them at warm ſervice till towards the Evening, and return'd when wearied without any loſs. A party of Men that went out late to be a rereguard to our Men at the Mill, were beat in by a party of Horſe that were diſpatch'd (with each a Footman behind him) from the Enemies Camp, but without loſs. This day Collonel <hi>Murray,</hi> Major <hi>Nath. Bull,</hi> Capt. <hi>Obrey,</hi> Capt. <hi>John Kennedy,</hi> Capt. <hi>Arch. Sanderſon,</hi> Capt. <hi>Mich. Cunningham,</hi> Capt. <hi>Will. Beatty,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Will Moor,</hi> and others, behaved themſelves with great bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: The Diſpute at both the Mills was very ſharp, and laſted ſome time. What number of the Enemy was kill'd we could not learn: We loſt but two Men, and had 8 or 10 wounded, who recovered.</p>
            <p>This Night Major <hi>Parker</hi> left this City, and deſerted their Majeſties Service here on this occaſion. A rereguard of Foot had been left to defend our Men from a Party of the Enemy, which we on the Walls ſaw coming on them. Theſe Major <hi>Parker</hi> was too ſlow and negligent in bringing off, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Orders, whereby they were expoſed to great danger from the Enemy. For this misbehaviour he was threatned with a Court-Martial, which he took this courſe to avoid.</p>
            <p>The Enemy planted their Mortar-pieces firſt in <hi>Strongs</hi> Orchard, on the other ſide of the water, and threw into Town ſome ſmall <hi>Bombs,</hi> which did not much hurt. Our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition was put into ſeveral places, as the Church, dry Wells, Cellars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time, that there might be a good underſtanding and harmony among the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, it was agreed to by Governour <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> that the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> ſhould have the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral-Church the one half of the Lord's day, during the whole time of the Siege, and the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> the other half; the latter entering at 12, had two Sermons there every Afternoon, beſides two or three other Meetings in other parts of the City: In their Aſſemblies there were every Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day conſiderable Collections for the relief of the poor People, and the ſick and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soldiers, who had otherwiſe periſht for any care was taken of them: And they had the uſe of the Cathedral every <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Governour <hi>Baker,</hi> together with Coll. <hi>Walker</hi> (who was alſo complemented with the Title of <hi>Governour,</hi> but always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with reference to the <hi>Stores,</hi> the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight whereof was (beſides his Regiment)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99417:21"/>the only truſt committed to him by the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon) to examine the Stores, and continue the old Store-keepers in their ſeveral places, till our Stores began to fail, and then all was put into one Store-houſe, which was carefully kept by Mr. <hi>Jo. Harvey,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Samuel</hi> all the time of the Siege. There were perſons appointed to ſearch all Cellars, and what Proviſions they found there, (which had been plentifully laid in by private Gentlemen and others of the Country,) they brought to the Store, and theſe were the ſupport of the Garriſon.</p>
            <p>Some of the chief Officers ſpoke to the <hi>N. C.</hi> Miniſters, to be Chaplains to their Regiments, as others to ſome of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts. Collonel <hi>Walker</hi> invited my ſelf to be his, the generality of his Officers as well as Soldiers being <hi>Nonconformiſts;</hi> yet the <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> Miniſters received no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance out of the Stores. Some of them had brought to Town a conſiderable ſtock of Proviſions of their own, which was taken to the publick Store-houſe, and others of them lived on their own money. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt</hi> Miniſters generally were maintained by the ſtore for ſome time, and after that had 2 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> 6 <abbr>
                  <hi>d.</hi>
               </abbr> a week paid them, while the others had no ſuch allowance, which had like to have been reſented to a high degree in the Garriſon, if ſome that conſidered our preſent circumſtances had not been careful to prevent it.</p>
            <p>About the 27th. of <hi>April,</hi> Captain <hi>Darcy</hi> (mentioned before, one that was brought from <hi>Scotland</hi> by Captain <hi>Hamilton</hi> before the Siege, and left Priſoner here, having fled from <hi>England</hi> where he was one of King <hi>James</hi>'s party,) had a paſs given him by our Governour to go with Horſe and Arms, which he accordingly did. Lieutenant Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Whitney</hi> had ſold him ſome Horſes, which were ſaid to be none of his own: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which and other miſdemeanours, <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> was confined, and afterwards tried by a Council of War, and found guilty of being no friend to this Garriſon, for which he was under confinement during the time of the Siege.</p>
            <p>About this time, Captain <hi>Lance</hi> is choſen Collonel to <hi>Colerain</hi> Regiment, which <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> had deſerted, and Captain <hi>Monro</hi> is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Collonel to <hi>Whitneys</hi>'s Regiment. So that now all the Regiments had their Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, which continued ſo during the whole time of the Siege.</p>
            <p>Governour <hi>Bakers</hi> Regiment of Foot, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 26 Companies.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Mitchelburn's,</hi> of 17 Companies.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Walker's,</hi> of 14 Companies.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Monro's,</hi> of 12 Companies.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Lance's,</hi> of 13 Companies.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Hamill's,</hi> of 15 Companies.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Croſton's,</hi> of 12 Companies.</p>
            <p>Collonel <hi>Murray's,</hi> Regiment of Horſe, conſiſting of 8 Troops.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe Men that were Regimented, there were ſeveral Volunteers in Town who did good ſervice, as Captain <hi>Joſeph John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> who was very careful to have good Padrolls kept; Captain <hi>William Crooke,</hi> and Mr. <hi>David Kennedy,</hi> and many others, who were frequently out upon Service; the firſt of theſe having his Leg broke with a piece of a <hi>Bomb,</hi> whereof he died.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> Collonel <hi>Mitchelburn</hi> was ſuſpected by Governour <hi>Baker</hi> and the Garriſon. The Governour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined him to his Chamber, betwixt whom there was ſome little ſcuffle when he was apprehended. He continued under the rules of Confinement, but was never tried by a Council of War: What the grounds of the ſuſpition were, is too tedious to relate, but he was afterwards nominated by <hi>Baker</hi> Governour during his ſickneſs.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time, Governour <hi>Baker</hi> (fearing leſt Enemies within the Town ſhould work Mines in Cellars near the Walls,) took with him Mr. <hi>William Mackie,</hi> one of the Citizens that was very active and induſtrious for defence of the Town: And they two ſearch't all Cellars near the Walls, under pretence of examining the Proviſions, but found nothing of what they feared.</p>
            <p>Few days paſs'd (while the Enemies Camp were coming nearer to us,) but Collonel <hi>Murray,</hi> Captain <hi>Noble,</hi> Captain <hi>Dumbar,</hi> Captain <hi>Andr. Adams,</hi> (afterwards Major,) Captain <hi>Wilſon,</hi> Captain <hi>Arch. Hamilton,</hi> Captain <hi>Beatty,</hi> Captain <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> Junior, (whoſe Father Captain <hi>Alexander Sanderſon</hi> was very uſeful in the Garriſon; So were alſo Major <hi>Alex. Stuart,</hi> Major <hi>John Dobbins,</hi> Cap. <hi>Char. Shaw,</hi> Cap. <hi>Sam. Wright,</hi> Cap. <hi>James Mac-Cormick:</hi>) Cap. <hi>Baſhford,</hi> Cap. <hi>Cuningham,</hi> Lieut. <hi>Dunlop,</hi> Lieut. <hi>Maghlin,</hi> or ſome of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99417:22"/>them, went out with ſmall parties, (and ſometimes private Soldiers only,) and they ſeldom returned without doing ſome execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Enemy, or bringing in ſome ſmall prey.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Noble</hi> and others, found ſeveral Letters in the Pockets of the ſlain, giving them ſome Intelligence, particularly about the ſurrender of <hi>Culmore:</hi> We were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that <hi>Lundy</hi> as he paſſed by, ſent a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to them that <hi>Derrry</hi> was ſurrendred: This added to the diſcouragement they were under, (having little Ammunition, and 8 of the Guns being before ſent up to Town by Captain <hi>Jemmet</hi> on <hi>Lundy</hi>'s orders,) is ſaid to have inclin'd them to follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the 5th. About the Middle of that Night, the Beſiegers under the Command of Brigadeer <hi>Ramſey,</hi> came to the <hi>Wind-Mill,</hi> and beat in our Out-Guards which were but few, and poſſeſſed themſelves of that place, and before Sun-riſing had a Line drawn from the Bog to the Water; it was old Ditches which they quickly made up.</p>
            <p>Early on <hi>May</hi> the 6th. Governour <hi>Baker</hi> and other Officers were about detaching 10 out of every Company to attack them, but the men were impatient and run out of their own accord, ſome at <hi>Biſhops-gate,</hi> others at <hi>Ferry-Key-gate,</hi> their number being thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, they advanced on the Enemy, who were come into the Ditches and old Walls, and beat them from Ditch to Ditch, till they were got into the Line they had made, where they ſo continually fired on them, that they forced them to quit the Line they had drawn, and flee for it. Our men purſued them ſo cloſe, that they came to Club-Muſquet with it. But their Foot and Dragoons flee in great confuſion. <hi>Ramſey</hi> endeavoured to rally them, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: For he and ſeveral other Officers were killed on the place; our men purſued them beyond all the Ditches to the top of the Hill, and drove Foot and Horſe all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: They returned about 12 a Clock. The Enemy loſt on the place about 200, (many of them ſhot in the Face, Forehead, and Breaſt over their own Line, as they were firing,) a great number alſo died of the wounds they then received.)</p>
            <p>In this action we got 4 or 5 Colours, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Drums, Fire-Arms, ſome Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good ſtore of Spades, Shovels, and Pick-axes. Of the Enemy theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Note were killed, <hi>viz.</hi> Brigadeer Gen. <hi>Ramſay,</hi> Capt. <hi>Barnwell,</hi> Capt. <hi>Fox,</hi> Capt. <hi>Flemming,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Kelley,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Welſh,</hi> Enſign <hi>Barnwell,</hi> Enſign <hi>Kadel.</hi> And the Perſons following were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, Lord <hi>Nettervile,</hi> Sir <hi>Gerrard Ayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Talbot,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Newcomen.</hi> We loſt but 3 or 4 pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men, and ſome wounded, particularly Lieutenant <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> who afterwards died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the 7th. Governour <hi>Baker</hi> deſires the Enemy to ſend ſome private Soldiers and an Officer to bury their dead, which they did after a very careleſs manner.</p>
            <p>This week Governour <hi>Baker,</hi> with the advice of ſome Officers, reſolves on draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a line croſs the Windmill hill from the Bogg to the Water. They ſet Men to work and ſoon finiſh'd it, and afterwards ſecur'd it with Redoubts, the better to defend our Men from a Cannon the Enemy planted on the other ſide the Water, directly oppoſite to the end of the Works our Men had made there: He alſo orders every Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be by turns on Guard Night and Day at this new line on the Windmill hill, but afterward the Guard was kept by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments out of each, occaſioned by a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of an Officer on that out-guard.</p>
            <p>About this time the 2 Captains (<hi>Cloſſes</hi>) left us and took Protection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 10. Lieutenant <hi>Mitchel</hi> went away alſo, (and came again with Major Gen. <hi>Kirk</hi> into the <hi>Lough.</hi>) About the ſame time Mr. <hi>John Brisben</hi> a Curate left the Town, and took Protection.</p>
            <p>A Party of our Men about 200, under the Command of Lieutenant Coll. <hi>Blair,</hi> were gone out, and were poſted among the Ditches, doing ſome Execution on the Enemy. A great Party of the Enemy were coming down on them, whom our men in the hollow could not ſee, but thoſe on the Walls ſeeing them, Coll. <hi>Murray</hi> rides a long Bog ſtreet, and tho a Party of the Enemy behind a Ditch fir'd inceſſantly at him, he went on to the place to warn them of the danger, ſo that they came off ſafely. Capt. <hi>Rickaby</hi> was ſhot in the Arm.</p>
            <p>The Beſiegers ſoon after plac'd a Camp at <hi>Ballingry,</hi> and another at <hi>Penny-burn-mill,</hi> and a third at the Orchard beyond the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99417:22"/>They kept the Guards ſo ſtrictly along the water on each ſide, that we were barr'd up from all intelligence.</p>
            <p>After the placing of theſe Camps, they brought their Guns to <hi>Ballyugry,</hi> and there ſucceſſively diſcharg'd them all in the dusk of the Evening: They alſo order'd their Men in a long range in all their Camps, and made them all fire round, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign (as we ſuppos'd) to ſtrike the greater Terror into the Hearts of the Beſieged. The Enemy were buſied in bearing Faggots, and making Forts or Trenches, and in ſome parts piling up theſe Faggots. Our Men ſally out, came to their Forts and Piles of Faggots, and burnt both them, and ſeveral little houſes the Enemy had for Quarters, with many Bridles, Sadles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſeveral both Officers and Souldiers. The Beſiegers had built a Trench near <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-burn-mill,</hi> on which they planted ſome of their Guns: Our Men reſolv'd in the Evening, that next Morning early they would attacque that Fort, and either bring away their Guns, or nail them up, and accordingly they went out, about 2 or 3000 Men, but effected not their Deſign (which was afterwards thought might have been accompliſh'd, if purſued.) Tho the Enemy diſcharg'd their Guns at our Men, none were hurt, one only was ſhot through the leg with a ſmall Bullet.</p>
            <p>About this time our Men went out, <hi>viz.</hi> Capt. <hi>Jo. Cunningham,</hi> Capt. <hi>Noble,</hi> Capt. <hi>Arch. Sanderſon,</hi> and ſome others. Theſe Captain with about 100 went too far out in the open Fields, where they ſeiz'd a Fort the Enemy had made on the Heathy-hill, and bear the Foot out of it. In the mean time a Party of the Enemies Horſe came at full Carrier betwixt our Men and the Town, took Capt. <hi>Cunningham</hi> Priſoner, whom, after Quarter given, they perfidiouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. (They gave us other inſtances af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards how faithleſs they were to their word. Particularly, they deſired one <hi>White</hi> might come over to ſome of his Friends, engaging their word for his and the Boats return; but they detain'd both him and the Boat, to our <hi>loſs</hi> who had no other, but to their greater <hi>reproach</hi> and diſhonour.) Capt. <hi>Noble,</hi> and the reſt came off being good Footmen: We loſt 15 or 16 men at that time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 21ſt. being Tueſday, the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> kept a ſolemn Faſt, and had Sermons in two places of the City beſides the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral, where there were conſiderable Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections made for the Poor, who begun to ſtand in greater need of 'em. Soon after the <hi>Conformists</hi> alſo kept another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 4th. being Tueſday. The Enemy approach to our Works at the <hi>Windmill</hi> with a great Body of Foot and Horſe: Our Men order'd themſelves ſo, that in each Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt there were four, and in ſome five Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs, ſo that they were in a Poſture of firing continually. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> divided their Horſe in 3 Parties, and their Foot in 2. The firſt Party of Horſe was commanded by Capt. <hi>Butler,</hi> (the Lord <hi>Mountgarrets</hi> Son,) and conſiſted moſt of Gentlemen, (who 'tis ſaid had ſworn to top our line:) They attacque our lines at the Water-ſide, and the other Parties of Horſe were to follow the firſt: The one Party of the Foot attacques the lines betwixt the Wind-mill and the water, and the other (being Granadeers) the lines at the Bogg-ſide, betwixt the <hi>Windmill</hi> and the <hi>Town.</hi> Captain <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanes,</hi> Capt. <hi>Andrew Adams,</hi> Capt. <hi>Francis Boyd,</hi> Capt. <hi>Robert Wallace,</hi> Capt. <hi>John Magh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and Captain <hi>Will. Beatty,</hi> with their Men, had taken their ground next the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The firſt Party of Horſe charg'd fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, having Faggots of wood carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; They came on with a huzza, ſeconded with a huge ſhout from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Camp: They came by the end of the line (it being low Water) notwithſtanding our firing conſtantly on them. Our Men, <hi>viz.</hi> Capt. <hi>James Gladſtanes,</hi> Capt. <hi>John Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanes,</hi> with others next to them, left their Redoubts, and took the Strand with their Musquets, Pikes and Scythes, and fell on them with that vigour, that ſoon ſpoiled the Tune of their Huzza's, for few of that Party eſcap'd: Many of them were driven into the River, and Capt. <hi>Butler</hi> himſelf ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner by Capt. <hi>John Gladſtanes.</hi> The reſt of the Horſe ſeeing the firſt Party ſo warmly receiv'd, had no great ſtomach to come on. In the mean time the Foot (who had alſo Faggots of wood carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them) attacque the line betwixt the Windmill and the Water: They were as warmly received as the Horſe: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they imagined our Men would fire all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99417:23"/>together, finding that they fired ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſoon wheeled about, and drew off; only a few came furiouſly to the back of our Works, and were either killed or hal'd over by the hair of their heads. In the mean time the other Party of Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Granadeers, attacque our Forts by the Bogg-ſide, and came on fiercely, but were as vigorouſly repuls't by our Men there. Coll. <hi>Monro</hi> did there acquit himſelf very well; Cap. <hi>Mich. Cunningham</hi> (one of the Citizens that had been always very active and zealous for the Defence of the Town) was at the Bogg-ſide with his Company, kept our Men to their Poſts, and oppoſed the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadeers with great Courage. He narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcap'd with his Life, a Cannon Bullet tearing up the ground about him, and he had a ſmall Bullet cut out of his Back; Lieutenant <hi>James Ker,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Joſias Abernethy,</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Clerk,</hi> did good Service, the laſt being wounded. Mr. <hi>Tho. Maxwell</hi> was kill'd about the ſame time on the Walls. This day Governour <hi>Baker</hi> ſhew'd both his <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and bringing out frequent Reliefs, where the greateſt danger appeared. Our Women alſo did good Service, carrying Ammunition, Match, Bread and Drink to our Men; and aſſiſted to very good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at the Bogg-ſide, in beating off the Granadeers with ſtones, who came ſo near to our lines. The Enemy loſt a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of Men. Moſt of their Officers were either kill'd or taken Priſoners. When they retreated, they carried away on their backs many of their Dead and mortally wounded with them, (as was ſuppoſed) to ſhelter themſelves the better from the ſtorm of our ſhot. Thoſe of Note kill'd on the Enemies ſide, were Lieutenant Coll. <hi>Farrell,</hi> two French Captains, Capt. <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Bourk,</hi> Quartermaſter <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Adjutant <hi>Fahoy,</hi> Enſign <hi>Norris,</hi> Enſign <hi>Arthur.</hi> The Priſoners were Capt. <hi>Butler,</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Mountgarret,</hi> Capt. <hi>Macdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> Cornet <hi>Mac-danaghy,</hi> Capt. <hi>Watſon,</hi> a French Lieutenant, Lieutenant <hi>Euſtace,</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jant <hi>Peggot.</hi> We loſt 5 or 6 private men, and one Captain <hi>Maxwell</hi> had his Arm broke with a Cannon Bullet, whereof he died within three weeks after. He had that Day behaved himſelf with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. And one <hi>Tho. Gow</hi> had all the Fleſh ſhot off the calfe of his Leg by a Cannon Bullet; but the bone not being broken, he recovered. There were three of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels out that day, <hi>Murray, Monro,</hi> and <hi>Hamil;</hi> The laſt got a hurt on the cheek with a ſmall Bullet.</p>
            <p>The next Day one Mr. <hi>Edmund Stones</hi> in time of a Parly went to a little Well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Bogg, having leave from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> firſt. But a French Officer came, and put-his own hand to Mr. <hi>Stones</hi>'s Cartridg-box, with the other treacherouſly pulled out his Sword to have killed him; but he ſtarting back the Sword only pierced his ſide, and the wound proved not mortal: So meanly baſe were ſome of our Enemies.</p>
            <p>From the 10th of <hi>May</hi> till near the end of the Siege, we had many little Parlies with the Enemy; ſometimes to admit Doctors to ſee the wounded Priſoners, the Lord <hi>Nettervile</hi> and <hi>Talbot;</hi> ſometimes to admit Proviſions to them, which we grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Sometimes that we might have leave with ſafety to ſend Meſſengers to the Ships, or abroad for intelligence, but that we could not obtain.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Cole</hi> had been among the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for near a month together at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Siege, and about the 10th or 12th of <hi>May</hi> came into Town again. Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Baker</hi> being ſuſpicious of his being an <hi>Agent</hi> for the Enemy, order'd him to be confin'd, till he was ſatisfied he had no ill deſign againſt the City, but had ſecretly made his Eſcape from the Enemy, who had detained him Priſoner.</p>
            <p>About the end of <hi>May,</hi> moſt of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers having been for ſome time ſuſpicious of Governour <hi>Walker,</hi> drew up ſeveral Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles againſt him, ſome of which were to the effect following, according to the Account I had of them from the Memories of ſome of the Officers then preſent.</p>
            <p>One was, <hi>That he and others about the</hi> 18th <hi>of</hi> April <hi>had a Secret Caball, wherein they agreed, and privately ſent a Meſſenger to K.</hi> James, <hi>with Propoſals about getting the Town to be delivered up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another was, <hi>That the ſaid Perſon being on his return confin'd on ſuſpicion of this, was taken out privately by Mr.</hi> Walkers <hi>means, and ſent over the Walls: He went to</hi> Culmore, <hi>which was ſoon after Surrendred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another was, <hi>That on ſeveral days, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99417:23"/>about the latter end of</hi> April, <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker <hi>held a Conſultation with ſome others in the Town, while our Men were out againſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, to ſhut the Gates upon them, to Facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a Surrender.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another was, <hi>For Selling or Embezling the Stores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another was, <hi>That he offer'd to betray the Town for</hi> 500 <abbr>l</abbr> 
               <hi>in hand, and</hi> 700 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>a Year, which offer was approv'd by K.</hi> J. <hi>and the Mony promiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another was, <hi>For abuſing Officers that went to the Stores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others of them relating to <hi>Perſonal Vices,</hi> I ſhall not mention.</p>
            <p>But for a more particular and full account of theſe Matters, I refer to the Articles themſelves, which were lodg'd in Collonel <hi>Hamills</hi> Hands.</p>
            <p>There were ſeveral Perſons had examin'd Witneſſes, and undertook to prove theſe Articles; And Collonel <hi>Hamill,</hi> Collonel <hi>Murray,</hi> Collonel <hi>Crofton,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Monro,</hi> Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> Captain <hi>Noble,</hi> Captain <hi>Dumbarr,</hi> and above a Hundred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers more, Subſcribed a Reſolution to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute him upon theſe Articles, in order to the removing him from all Truſt either in the <hi>Stores,</hi> or in the <hi>Army.</hi> This occaſioned a Motion which Governour <hi>Baker</hi> readily aſſented to, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the Government of the <hi>Stores,</hi> as well as the <hi>Garriſon</hi> ſhould be managed by a Council of 14, of which he was to be <hi>Preſident,</hi> and nothing be done but by them. But the <hi>Meetings</hi> of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil were ſoon after, through the Difficulty of the Seige, eſpecially the danger of the <hi>Bombs,</hi> much interrupted, though the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of it continued till the end of the Siege. This being granted them, Governour <hi>Baker</hi> earneſtly perſwaded, and at laſt prevail'd with them to deſiſt at that time from the Proſecution of the forementioned Articles. Yet theſe Articles were reviv'd, and increas'd to the number of 14, ſoon after Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Bakers</hi> Death. Yet all this did not ſufficiently caution Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> from what the Garriſon lookt on, as an intruding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into that part of the Government that was never intended him: For after Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Bakers</hi> Death, he call'd a Court-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and appointed Lieutenant-Collonel <hi>Campbell</hi> to be <hi>Preſident</hi> of it. The Officers hearing that the <hi>Court</hi> was ſet, came in, and publickly diſcharg'd them from Sitting any longer, declaring that he had no power that appointed them, and accordingly they were preſently Diſſolv'd.</p>
            <p>There are but two things relating to the Articles forementioned I would take notice of. Thoſe who moſt ſuſpected the deſign mention'd in the third Article to be real, privately agreed in all their Sallies, afterwards to keep a good Reſerve in the Town for the prevention of it, the Care whereof was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by turns to Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Cairns</hi> and Captain <hi>James Gladſtanes,</hi> (two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that ſhew'd great Fidelity and Prudence in the Council, as well as Courage in ſeveral Sallies for the Defence of the City.) And the 4th Article occaſion'd an <hi>Order</hi> of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil that Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> Note ſhould not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the Keepers, till ſign'd by the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor</hi> or Major <hi>Adams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 5th. The Beſiegers had thrown a great many ſmall <hi>Bombs</hi> before this, but they began about this time with great ones of 273 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> weight, each of them being weigh'd after 17 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> of powder had been taken out of it. Some of theſe (both great and ſmall) did not break, having loſt their Fire: Thoſe which they threw in the <hi>Night,</hi> did not much hurt to people that were able to go to the Walls; Becauſe they were eaſily ſeen and ſhun'd: But ſeveral that were Sick were kill'd in their Houſes. We were in greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard by thoſe thrown in the <hi>Day,</hi> it being more difficult to ſee them: The dread of them forc't our people to lye about the Walls all Night, and to go to the places remoteſt from Houſes, ſome out of <hi>Ferry-key gate,</hi> ſome to the <hi>Ravelin,</hi> and others to the <hi>Wind-mill-hill;</hi> And the Cold which the Men, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Women and Children con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted hereby, added to their want of Reſt and Food, occaſioned Diſeaſes in the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as <hi>Feavers, Flux,</hi> &amp;c. of which great Numbers died. The <hi>Bombs</hi> by throwing down ſome Houſes, furniſht us with Fewel, which we then ſtood in great need of: One of theſe <hi>Bombs</hi> fell into the Houſe of Captain <hi>James Boyd,</hi> and broke down the ſide of it, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf; But ſeveral Officers who were then at Dinner, eſcap'd the Danger, tho it fell near the Room where they Din'd. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bomb</hi> kill'd Mr. <hi>Alexander Lindſay</hi> the Chirurgeon, who was very uſeful to the Sick and Wounded Soldiers. And one Major <hi>Breme</hi> was kill'd with a Canon-Ball: Another <hi>Bomb</hi> killed Mr. <hi>Henry Thompſon</hi> a Burgeſs of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99417:24"/>this City, who ſhewed great Zeal for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it: Another killed 14 Men, and Fir'd one or two Barrels of Powder in a back Houſe. Another killed 7, another kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led 3 of our Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 7th. There came 3 Ships up to <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> and fir'd at the Caſtle ſeveral days, and one of them running a ground, or being left by the Tide, was much endanger'd by the Enemies Canon. The Enemy call'd to us from their Lines, to ſend down Carpenters to mend her: But we ſoon had the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeeing her get off again.</p>
            <p>About this time Governour <hi>Baker</hi> was a little indiſpoſed, and kept his Chamber.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 13th. Major General <hi>Kirk</hi> appears with a Fleet in the <hi>Lough</hi> below <hi>Culmore,</hi> which gave us at the preſent the joyful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, not only of the Siege being ſoon rais'd, but of being furniſht with Proviſions, which then grew very ſcarce, as appears by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance our Men then had from the Stores. They were already Reduc't to ſuch Straits, that where they could find a Horſe a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing near the Windmil, they would kill and eat him: But when we ſaw them lye in the <hi>Lough</hi> without any Attempt to come up, it caſt a cold damp on our too confident hopes, and ſunk us as low as we were rais'd at the firſt ſight of them.</p>
            <p>Upon the appearing of the Ships, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy ſeem'd to be in a mighty Conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: We obſerv'd a great Motion in their Camp of pulling down Tents, (as we heard,) in order to decamping; And many of their common Soldiers (as the Country people inform'd us) changed their red Coats, and ran away. But the Terror was ſoon over, when they ſaw them make no great Attempt to come up, tho they had both, Wind and Tide to aſſiſt them. And the Enemy quickly began to draw down their Cannon, and ſoon after to raiſe Batteries at <hi>Charlesfort,</hi> where they planted ſome of their Guns to oppoſe the Ships coming up to our Relief: And ſome time after they begun to make a <hi>Boom</hi> croſs the River from that <hi>Fort</hi> to <hi>Brook-Hall,</hi> directly oppoſite to it. This firſt <hi>Boom</hi> was made of Oak-Beams, chain'd together with Iron and great Cables twiſted about them: For a week together we ſaw them making ſome Preparations for this <hi>Boom</hi> croſs the River, as drawing of Timber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We afterwards ſaw ſeveral Boats on the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter buſied about it, but (as the Country people ſince inform'd us,) it was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely finiſht till about a fortnight after the Ships appear'd in the <hi>Lough.</hi> But this <hi>Boom</hi> when finiſht, was uſeleſs to their deſign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it did not Float, and it was broke by the great Tides: After this they made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Fir-Beams, chain'd as the other was. This Floated, and ſerv'd their purpoſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; But this latter <hi>Boom,</hi> or what was leſt of it, the <hi>Mountjoy</hi> of <hi>Derry</hi> broke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 16th. Coll. <hi>Walker</hi> had propos'd to agree with the Enemy to take 500 <abbr>

               </abbr> ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for Lieut. Coll. <hi>Talbot.</hi> A ſort of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was held in Gov. <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chamber, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this was carried; but Gov. <hi>Baker</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it to be ill reſented in the Garriſon, declin'd it: But Coll. <hi>Walker</hi> urg'd it with ſome violence and threats againſt thoſe that oppos'd it; and order'd the Bier that ſhould carry him away to be this day brought to his Lodging; at which the multitude were ſo enrag'd, that Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſhould take ſo much on him, that they took the Bier and made a fire of it in the Main-guard. They ſearch'd for Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> who had fled for ſanctuary to <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chamber in the Biſhop's Houſe: Not finding him immediately, they took all the Priſoners that were able to walk from their ſeveral Lodgings, and carried them to Gaol: They had ſearcht Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s own Lodging, whence they took the Beer, Mum, &amp; Butter, which they found to the Store: And being inform'd that Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> was in the <hi>Biſhops-houſe,</hi> they purſued him, ſome threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſhoot him, others to ſend him to the Gaol. Governour <hi>Baker,</hi> to whom they pay'd a great deference, came out (though indiſpos'd) to pacifie them, engag'd there ſhould be no ranſom taken for the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, entreated them for his ſake to paſs by what Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> had done, and ſuffer the Priſoners to go to their own Lodgings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; all which they (with ſome difficulty) conſented to, at Governour <hi>Baker</hi>'s entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. What conſtruction the multitude put on this Practice of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s, I think not fit to mention.</p>
            <p>We afterwards offer'd to releaſe Lieut. Coll. <hi>Talbot,</hi> on Condition they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Meſſenger to go and return from the Ships; but this would not be granted, and ſoon after <hi>Talbot</hi> died, and put an end to this Diſpute.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:99417:24"/>
            <p>About this time the Feaver, Flux, and other Diſtempers grew rife, and a great mortality ſpread it ſelf through the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as the Inhabitants, inſomuch as it was obſerv'd, that 15 Captains or Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants died in one day: And the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being in great ſtrait for want of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, ſome of the Citizens and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the publick good, met, call'd the Captain of the Gunners, <hi>Alexander Watſon,</hi> and order'd the Gunners (who for the moſt part liv'd in Town) to make diligent ſearch for Proviſions, which they did to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for digging up Cellars and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they got much Proviſion under the ground, which ſome that went away, and others during the Siege had hid: And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſaw how ſincerely concern'd they were for the ſafety of the place, brought forth their Proviſions of their own accord. By this means the Garriſon was furniſht with Bread (though the allowance was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle) 'till the end of the Siege.</p>
            <p>Our Iron-bullet was much ſpent, but this defect was ſupplied with Lead-bullets made with pieces of <hi>Brick</hi> in the middle of them. <hi>Will. Brown,</hi> Adjutant to Governour <hi>Baker</hi>'s Regiment, was induſtrious and dexterous in this piece of Service.</p>
            <p>There was Oats, Shilling, and Malt in Town, which could not be uſed for want of Mills; therefore Capt. <hi>Gregory</hi> and ſome other Work men took care to have a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill built, as alſo to have Carriages made for the Guns, ſome of which were ſo out of order, that ſometimes we could not uſe them when we wanted them</p>
            <p>About this time, ſince the Enemy had ſo barr'd us up from getting any Meſſenger ſent to the Ships for Intelligence, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged built a Boat (none being here) to go down by Water; Lieut. <hi>Crookshanks</hi> took care of this, and ſome of our men in the night attempted to go down in it, but they were beat back by the Enemies ſhot from each ſide of the Water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 17. or thereabouts, Gover. <hi>Baker</hi>'s Diſtemper encreaſes, and he becomes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ill; and Coll. <hi>Mitchelburn</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by <hi>Baker</hi> Governour during his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 18. Coll. <hi>Murray,</hi> Capt. <hi>Noble,</hi> Capt. <hi>Dumbar,</hi> Capt. <hi>Homes,</hi> two Lieutenants, and about 20 more went up the Water in the Night in our New Boat; 'twas given out to rob the Fiſh-houſes in the Iſſe, but the real Deſign was to land a Meſſenger or two in a Wood about 4 Miles up the River, to ſend to <hi>Inniskillin:</hi> But the Enemy ſoon took the Alarm, and as the Boat paſs'd by <hi>Evans</hi> Wood, they fir'd a great Gun plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there at her, which narrowly miſs'd her. As our Men went further up, the Enemy fir'd at them on both ſides the ſhore: But when they came up to <hi>Dunnelong</hi> Wood, where they deſign'd to land their 2 Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the Boys were ſo terrified that they durſt not venture aſhore; and it being now early in the Morning, our Men diſcovered two large Boats behind them, which the Enemy had ſet out and mann'd with <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons</hi> to cut off their return: Our Men made towards them, and ſoon came to a very ſharp engagement; for after their ſhot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent on both ſides, one of the Enemys Boats came up cloſe to theirs, thinking to have boarded them; but as it happily fell out, they <hi>Catcht a Tartar;</hi> for our Men were as quickly in upon them, beat back ſome of them into the Water, and kill'd 3 or 4 others, beſides a Lieutenant in the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Boat, whereupon the reſt threw down their Arms and call'd for quarter. We took 13 Priſoners in this Boat: The Enemy in the other Boat ſeeing this ill ſucceſs of their Friends, made off with what haſte they could. We carried our Priſoners and ſome ſmall Prize towards the City, the Enemy ſtill firing at us from the ſhore; yet in all this Adventure not one of our Men was hurt, (except Coll. <hi>Murray,</hi> who received ſome ſhots in his Head-piece that bruiſed his Head, and for a while indiſpoſed him for ſervice) but one of the Priſoners that ſat among them was wounded by a ſhot from the ſhore. So remarkable was the Guard of Divine Providence about us. Our Men being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by this Succeſs, landed their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners near the City, deliver'd them to the Guards, and return'd to attacque a Party of the Enemy who were at that time drawing off one of their Guns; but the Enemy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the reſolute approach of our Men, left her and fled: Our Men purſued them to the top of the Hill, 'till they perceived another ſtrong Party marching under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of the Hill, to get betwixt them and their Boats, upon which they retreated,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99417:25"/>and had ſcarce time to recover her before the Enemy came up.</p>
            <p>About the 20th. of <hi>June, Conrad de. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> Mareſchal General of K. <hi>James</hi>'s Forces, arriv'd at the Enemies Camp, and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rais'd ſeveral Batteries in the Night, and a Line on the other ſide of the <hi>Bogg</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the <hi>Wind-mill,</hi> and brought their <hi>Camp</hi> and Trenches near to us, and run a Line through the Orchard, oppoſite to <hi>Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers-gate,</hi> within ſome few Perches of it, and order'd the <hi>Mortar-pieces</hi> to be taken from the Orchard on the other ſide the Water, and plac'd on the ſide of the Hill above the <hi>Bogg,</hi> on the Weſt-ſide of the <hi>Town,</hi> and planted their battering Guns (which threw a Ball of 20 or 21 Pounds weight) at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient diſtance before the <hi>Butchers-gate:</hi> They ply'd us hard both with their Bombs and Battering-Guns: The Bombs they threw ſome in the Night, and ſome in the day, at uncertain hours, 'till the 21ſt. of <hi>July,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which time they threw no more. Of the number of the Bombs, and the time of their throwing, you'l find an account an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed. And here began the cloſe Siege.</p>
            <p>We uſed all endeavours to get Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from the Ships, but could have none. We made many ſigns from the Steeple, both by Canon-ſhot and drawing in our Flagg, to repreſent our diſtreſſed condition to them. But <hi>June</hi> 25. one <hi>Roch,</hi> a Meſſenger, came to Town from Major General <hi>Kirk;</hi> when he came to the Water-ſide, having no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a Boat, he ſwam over, and gave us an account of the Ships, Men, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Arms that were there for our Relief; adding, that 'twas deſir'd if he got ſafe to Town, to give them in the Ships no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it by 4 Guns from the Steeple, which was accordingly done. There came ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meſſenger along with him, one <hi>Cromy;</hi> but becauſe he cou'd not ſwim, he lay hid a day or two in the Buſhes, expecting a Boat to be ſent for him in the Night, as the other had promiſed: But the Enemies Guards found him, and being in hazard of his Life, they made him Promiſe to give the Beſieged a diſcouraging Account, and then hung out a Flag for a Parly, which was granted, and ſome were ſent over the Water to diſcourſe him: He (being ſworn to do ſo) repeated to them the Words that had been put into his Mouth; but when Lieut. Coll. <hi>Blair</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired why he gave a different Account from what <hi>Roch</hi> had done, he reply'd, He was in the Enemy's Camp, <hi>Roch</hi> within the Walls of <hi>Derry. Roch</hi> tried to go to Major General <hi>Kirk</hi> again, but was forc'd to come back becauſe of the Enemies Guards on the Water-ſide.</p>
            <p>This extreamly troubled us, that no Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger could get down to give the Major General an Account of our diſtreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. There came one <hi>Mac Gimpſy</hi> to Coll. <hi>Murray,</hi> and voluntarily offered to ſwim down the Water with Intelligence. Coll. <hi>Murray</hi> acquaints the Deputy Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Mitchelburn</hi> with it; but he delaying, he reſolved to ſend him down, promiſed a Reward, and wrote by him a Letter ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by himſelf, his Lieutenant Collo. <hi>Cairns,</hi> and Captain <hi>Gladſtanes,</hi> repreſenting the great extremity they were reduced to, and with all imaginable earneſtneſs importuning ſpeedy Relief.</p>
            <p>This Letter was cloſe tyed in a little Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in which were put 2 Musquet Bullets, that if the Enemy ſhould take him, he might break the little ſtring wherewith 'twas tied about his Neck, and ſo let it fink in the Water. Whether this Meſſenger was taken alive by the Enemy, or was kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by running himſelf againſt the <hi>Boom</hi> (as ſome reported) is uncertain; But within a Day or two they hung up a Man on a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the view of the City on the other ſide the water, and called over to us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us it was our Meſſenger.</p>
            <p>The Enemy work every Night to bring their Trenches near the Walls for Mineing. Our Men were diligent to counter-line them, being incited to it every Night by Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Mitchelburn.</hi> Theſe Works were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by the care of Capt. <hi>Schambroon,</hi> and the indefatigable Pains and Charges of Capt. <hi>Michael Cuningham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Will. Mackee,</hi> who both pay'd ſome of the Soldiers for working out of their own Pockets, and gave many of thoſe that wrought Meat at their own Houſes: Hereby the Enemy were kept from getting to the near ſide of the Bogg, without which they could Draw no Mines: There was beſides a <hi>Blind</hi> rais'd by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons forementioned before the <hi>Butchers-gate,</hi> to defend it from the Enemies battering Guns, which had already done ſome hurt to it. A Collection, by way of Free-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99417:25"/>was made among the Inhabitants to carry on this work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> the 28th. The Lord <hi>Clancarty</hi> with his Regiment comes to the Beſiegers Camp, and that Night attackt our Out-works at the <hi>Butchers-gate,</hi> and few of our men being out at that time, they ſoon poſſeſſed themſelves of them. In the mean time, they were throwing their <hi>Bombs,</hi> one of them coming ſhort of the Walls, fell among their own men, which diſcovered them on their March towards the ſaid Works: Upon this, the few men that were out retired within the Gate. The Enemy was led on by their Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Skelton,</hi> who had ſome detachments with him beſides <hi>Clancarties</hi> Regiment: One on Horſeback comes cloſe to the Gate, and called for Fire to burn it. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Noble,</hi> and <hi>Dumbar</hi> ſally out with our men, ſome at <hi>Biſhops-gate,</hi> and ſome at <hi>Butchers-gate,</hi> to the number of 60 or 80 at firſt, more ſoon followed. The ſallyers attack them ſo briskly, being well aſſiſted from the Walls by great and ſmall ſhot, that they were forc't to quit our Works, and run to their own Lines, to their great diſhonour as well as loſs. The number of thoſe killed on the place was about 30, how many were wounded, and afterwards died, we could not tell. Some Officers were killed, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>French</hi> Lieutenant Collonel, Captain <hi>Obrian,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Captain, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captain, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lieutenant, Captain <hi>Macka<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rtie,</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral <hi>Mac-Guire,</hi> and a private So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ldier, were taken Priſoners.</p>
            <p>At this time Governour <hi>Baker</hi> died, juſtly lamented by the Garriſon, in whoſe affections his prudent and reſolute Conduct had given him a great Intereſt. After Governour <hi>Bakers</hi> death, there were ſeveral meetings appointed for the Election of a Governour, but continual action prevented them: However Collonel <hi>Mitchelburn,</hi> who had been Deputy Governour during <hi>Bakers</hi> ſickneſs, continued to act as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, tho without any confirmation from the Council.</p>

But it was diſmal to us to hear their cryes, when we perceived who they were, and ſaw the Fne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my driving them with their drawn Swords down to the Walls: Our men reſolved to put them without our Lines at the <hi>Wind-Mill,</hi> and in the Night many of them were brought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Lines; It mov'd our compaſſion the more, when theſe poor people ſo earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated us, <hi>not to ſurrender out of pity to them,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>that they knew they would ſave neither us nor them alive after it.</hi> This put the Governour
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99417:26"/>and Officers on making the following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: They immediately ordered a Gallows to be Erected on the Baſtion next the Camp, on which they threaten to hang all the Priſoners (now put into Gaol) if theſe people have not leave to go to their ſeveral Habitations. Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Collonel <hi>Campbell,</hi> and Captain <hi>Jenny</hi> a Clergyman (two Gentlemen that were very Faithful and Active in the Garriſon) are ſent to remind them of preparing for death: Upon which they writ this following Letter, and have leave to ſend a Meſſenger to carry it, and bring back an Anſwer.</p>

            <p>But notwithſtanding this Anſwer, we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the regard they had to their Impriſon'd Friends prevail'd with them: For the poor people had liberty to return to their Dwellings on the third of <hi>July,</hi> and many of our weak peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Women got away among them, tho they ſent many back knowing them by their Colour: We got ſome able Men among them, which were driven in, who ſtay'd with us to the end of the Siege. The Enemy ſoon ſaw their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in this Treatment of the poor People: The Garriſon had here a convincing Inſtance before their Eyes, how little Truſt there was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in their Promiſes: For many of theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had Protections under the <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generals</hi> own hands: And this could not fail of making them obſtinate againſt all Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of Surrendring, while it was poſſible to hold out. The people being ſent away, the Gallows was taken down, and the Priſoners ſent to their ſeveral Lodgings: About this time, Mr. <hi>Andrew Robinſon</hi> left us, but the Enemy ſtript and ſent him back, becauſe of ſome imprudent Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Beatty</hi> alſo went away, and took Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and liv'd at <hi>Mony-more.</hi> But the reaſon of it was, becauſe he had a Violent Flux, which render'd him uſeleſs to the Garriſon, and he went to try if he could recover his Health: For he had been at all the Encounters and Skirmiſhes with the Enemy before, and ever behaved himſelf with great Integrity and Valour.</p>
            <p>About the 6th or 7th of <hi>July,</hi> we obſerv'd few Men about their Camps: Governour <hi>Mitchelburn</hi> by Advice draws out the Body of our Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our Lines at the <hi>Wind-mill,</hi> that we might know what Body of Men would appear to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them: Some of our Men go down to the old Ditches, and fire at theirs in their Lines. The Enemy fir'd at them, Collonel <hi>Barker</hi> with about a dozen Horſe came to the <hi>Strand,</hi> and ſtood at a diſtance: Few of their Foot, not above two Companies appear Marching down to the reſt that were in the Lines: But it growing dark, our Men by miſtaking the word of Command, came within our own Lines again in ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: Collonel <hi>Barker</hi> receiv'd a Shot in his Hand, which put him into an high Feaver, whereof he was reported to have dyed.</p>
            <p>About this time, we heard a loud Huzza in all the Camps of the Enemy round the City, which when we inquired the reaſon of, they told us it was for joy of <hi>Inniskillin</hi> being taken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> the 11th. The Enemy calls for a Parly, and ſends one to know if we wou'd Treat with them for Surrendring the City. We conſider'd moſt of the Ships were gone, we knew not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Proviſions grew extreamy ſcarce; and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99417:27"/>therefore to gain time, it was thought adviſable to agree to it: They deſired that if we agree to Treat, there may be 6 Commiſſioners cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen on each ſide, that we ſend the Names of the 6 we would chooſe, and the Terms we would demand with ſome perſon the next day being the 12th, and they would ſend the Names of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the ſame day, that they might have time to conſider our Terms. And <hi>Saturday</hi> 13 was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the day of Treaty: All which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to.</p>
            <p>The Names of the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> and the <hi>Terms,</hi> you'l find in the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> annext in the end.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Articles</hi> were ſent to the Enemy, with the Names of the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> for the City, on the 12th of <hi>July,</hi> and on the 13th, the 6 <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi> went out, being empowr'd to Treat with the Enemy.</p>
            <p>About their <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> there was great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: Some of the Council of fourteen, would have had the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> run in their Name; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had the power: <hi>Mitchelburn</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> laid ſome claim to it (though Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> had only his firſt Poſt, and <hi>Mitchelburn</hi> was only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Governour by <hi>Baker</hi> during his Sickneſs; but never confirm'd Governour by a Council.) The Collonels and other Officers would have had it run in theirs; becauſe the Intereſt was chiefly theirs. But at laſt the Name of <hi>Governours</hi> in General, without any particular Application of it, was (tho not without great Oppoſition) thought fit to be uſed, for this reaſon, that the Enemy might not look upon us as a <hi>Confuſed</hi> multitude without any <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 13th. Our Commiſſioners went out to the Enemies Camp, and had a long Debate till Night with the Commiſſioners on their ſide. The Enemy conſented to all things material deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the foreſaid Articles, except 3. viz. 1. <hi>The time for Surrendring: They would grant no longer time than till</hi> Monday <hi>the</hi> 15 <hi>at</hi> 12 <hi>a Clock.</hi> 2. <hi>The Securing of Hoſtages, they would allow they ſhould be kept in</hi> Derry; <hi>but not put into the Ships that Major Gen.</hi> Kirk <hi>brought.</hi> 3. <hi>The manner of Marching out: They would allow no Arms to our Souldiers, but only to the Officers and Gentlemen in Town.</hi> Our Commiſſioners return'd, and with great Difficulty obtained time till next day at 12 a Clock to return an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>That Night, after the return of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, there was a Council, where the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners gave an Account of their Negotiation that day, and a Council was appointed at 8 a Clock the next. Morning, to conſider what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer they ſhould return.</p>
            <p>While our Commiſſioners were out on the Treaty, Collonel <hi>Walker</hi> receiv'd a Letter from Lieutenant <hi>David Mitchell</hi> out of the Ships by a little Boy, and Tranſcribed it with ſome Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own: For whereas the Letter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Major General <hi>Kirks</hi> having ſent ſome to Encamp at <hi>Inch,</hi> he wrote it 4000 Horſe, and 9000 Foot; This humour was the more unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, becauſe upon the return of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, he earneſtly urg'd a complyance with the Enemies demands, for Surrendering the Town the next day: And therefore when the Contents of his Letter from Lieutenant <hi>Mitchel</hi> were Objected to him as a ſtrong Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Surrendering, eſpecially the Numbers that were Landed, he confeſs't that part of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have been fram'd by himſelf: Which indiſcretion, joyn'd with his ill Advice, had like to have prov'd of as Dangerous Conſequence to himſelf, as the Advice had been to the Garriſon, if they had complyed with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 14th. The Council met, and had ſome debate about the Anſwer to be return'd: And the following Anſwer was reſolv'd upon (not without renewed Oppoſition from Collonel <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,) That unleſs the Enemy would give us time till the</hi> 26th <hi>of</hi> July, <hi>and ſecure the Hoſtages in the Ships, we would not Surrender:</hi> And for the manner of Marching out, that was left to the Commiſſioners to Debate. The Commiſſioners went out, and delivered this Anſwer: But the Enemy refuſing abſolutely to grant theſe Terms, the Treaty was ended. So evidently did that gracious God (who had Determined our Deliverance, and to whoſe all-comprehending Eye that particular Seaſon of it that would moſt Illuſtrate his own Glory was obvious) infatuate the Councils, and harden the Hearts of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: Had they accepted the Propoſals, the City had been unavoidably Surrendred; And we could not have held out 3 or 4 days longer than the time we deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> the 16th. About 10 a Clock, a ſmall Party of the Enemy ſuddenly Attack't our works without <hi>Butchers</hi> Gate (none of our Men being out) and ſoon poſſeſt themſelves of them; But from the Walls they were warmly Repuls't, and beat off again. Our Men beat them with Stones out of the old Walls. Some few were kill'd, and one taken Priſoner in this Action.</p>
            <p>Two Regiments of the Enemy March't down from their Camp in order, towards the works on the <hi>Windmill-hill.</hi> Our Men go out chearfully to the Works in conſiderable Numbers, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd thereto by Governour <hi>Mitchelburn</hi> The Enemy when they came to the middle of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99417:27"/>Hill ſtopt, and wheel'd about, and March't back again up the other ſide of the <hi>Park.</hi> Our Men rais'd an Huzza from one end of the Line to the other, waving their Hats to them to come down, but they March't off.</p>
            <p>This day Collonel <hi>Murray,</hi> and about 12 more with him, went down to Flank the Enemies Trench before <hi>Butchers</hi> Gate, and continued fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring till their Ammunition was ſpent; One of his Men was kill'd, <hi>viz. James Murray,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhot through both the Thighs up near his Body, which prov'd ſo dangerous to him, that he did not fully recover of it till near <hi>November.</hi> A few days after he was wounded, there fell out a ſad Accident in his Chamber. Lieutenant <hi>Roſs</hi> came there, to ſearch as he pretended for ſome of Sir <hi>Arthur. Rawden</hi>'s Saddles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected rudeneſs, occaſioned ſome heat betwixt him, and one of Coll. <hi>Murrays</hi> Regiment, and the Lieutenant, ſtriking ſeveral times at him with his Sword, the other took up a Carbine and ſhot him dead.</p>
            <p>The Enemy had play'd very ſmartly at the Town and Gate with their battering Guns, and about this time, they took them away in the Night down to <hi>Brook-Hall,</hi> where the Boom was, and planted them there.</p>
            <p>There was no Action of Note from this time to the 25th of <hi>July:</hi> The Enemy had ſeveral Cows feeding behind their Lines very near us; Our Men reſolve they will try to get ſo welcome a prey into their own Hands, and accordingly <hi>July</hi> 25th. early in the Morning they go out at <hi>Shipkey, Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Butchers</hi> Gates, Surpriz'd Sir <hi>John Fitzgerald's</hi> Regiment who were in thoſe Lines, made havock of them, beat them from their Trenches, kill'd Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerald;</hi> and Captain <hi>Franc Wilſon</hi> took Captain <hi>Nugent</hi> Priſoner. A Party of the Enemies from the neareſt Camp came quickly down, which forc't our Men (being then enfeebled with the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Proviſion) to retire without their deſired Prey. There was a conſiderable number of the Enemy kill'd; We loſt one Lieutenant <hi>Fiſher,</hi> who was kill'd by a ſhot from the Enemies Drake, as he was going out. We afterwards tried another Experiment of tying a Cow to a ſtake, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fire to her, in hope of drawing in ſome of theirs; but ſhe breaking looſe that project fail'd.</p>
            <p>About the 20th of this Month, Proviſions growing extreamly ſcarce; one Mr. <hi>James Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham</hi> Merchant, found out a way of ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Garriſon for ſix or ſeven days: He ſhew'd them where there was a good quantity of Starch in the Town, which they mixt with Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and made pancakes of: Which proved not only good food, but Phyſick too to many of thoſe whom Wearineſs and ill Diet had caſt into a Flux.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 28. This Morning Captain <hi>Charleton</hi> left us, and went to the Enemy. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> about this time had preacht a diſcouraging Sermon: And indeed the deſperate Neceſſities that were growing upon us had almoſt ſunk us all into a Deſpair of Relief. But the hour of our Extremity was the fit ſeaſon for Divine Providence to interpoſe, and render it ſelf the more obſervable in our Deliverance: For this Evening about ſeven a Clock we perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 3 Ships (<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Mountjoy</hi> of <hi>Derry,</hi> the <hi>Phenix</hi> of <hi>Colerain,</hi> and the <hi>Dartmouth</hi> Frig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t,) coming up the <hi>Lough</hi> of <hi>Culmore,</hi> betwixt whom and thoſe in the <hi>Fort</hi> there was deſperate fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But when we perceiv'd they had paſſed the <hi>Fort,</hi> our Expectations of ſpeedy Succour raiſed us to a ſtrange tranſport of Joy. The Enemy plyed them with Cannon and ſmall Shot from both ſides the River, and the Ships made them good Returns: But when the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Veſſel came (as 'tis ſuppoſed) to the <hi>Boom,</hi> ſhe made ſome ſtop, the little Wind they had while they paſs'd the <hi>Fort</hi> entirely fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a dead calm ſucceeding. The ſmoak of the Shot both from the Land and from the Ships clouded her from our ſight, and ſhe was (as we afterwards learnt) unhappily run a ground. And when the Enemy, who gathered in ſwarms to the Water-ſide, rais'd a loud Huzza along the Shore, telling us, <hi>Our Ships were taken,</hi> and we perceiv'd them both firing their Guns at them, and preparing Boats to board them, this ſtruck ſuch a ſudden <hi>Terror</hi> into our Hearts, as appeared in the very blackneſs of our Countenances. Our Spirits ſunk, and our hopes were expiring. But this did not continue long: For the <hi>Mountjoy</hi> by firing a Broad-ſide, with the help of the encreaſing Tide, got off from the Shore. And we ſoon perceiv'd the Ships firing at them, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing towards us, tho but ſlowly, which made the Enemy draw their Guns from place to to place after them. But at laſt they came up to the <hi>Key,</hi> to the inexpreſſible Joy of our Garriſon, that was at this time reduc'd to that Diſtreſs, that 'twas ſcarce poſſible for them to ſubſiſt above 2 or 3 Days longer. The firſt that broke or paſs'd the <hi>Boom</hi> was the <hi>Mountjoy</hi> of <hi>Derry,</hi> commanded by Capt. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah Browning,</hi> who was to our great regrett kill'd by the Enemies ſhot. (A Gentleman, whoſe Memory ſhould never be forgotten by the Garriſon and Inhabitants of <hi>Derry,</hi> who
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99417:28"/>generouſly ſacrtfic'd his own life for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of theirs, and had freely offer'd to make this Attempt ſooner, if the Major Gen. would have permitted him:) But the <hi>Phoenix</hi> of <hi>Colerain</hi> came firſt to the Key, Capt. <hi>Andrew Douglaſs</hi> Maſter, laden with 800 Bowls of Meal from <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Ships came in late: And that we might the better ſecure the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple employed in bringing in the Proviſions to the Stores, there was a Blind made along the Key of Casks and Hogsheads fill'd with earth. The Enemy continued to fire at us from their Trenches, as before, till the 31ſt of <hi>July.</hi> That day we perceiv'd them firing ſeveral parts of the Countrey about. In the Night they burnt all the Tents and Hutts of their Camp round the City, and before the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light had gone off towards <hi>Lifford</hi> and <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane,</hi> keeping a ſtrong rereguard of Horſe. We had no Horſe left to purſue them, and our Foot were in no condition to make ſuch an Attempt. They encamp'd at <hi>Lifford</hi> and <hi>Strabane,</hi> till they heard the unwelcome News of their Forces under the Command of Major General <hi>Maccarty,</hi> being routed by the <hi>Inis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killing</hi> Men. This ſo allarm'd them, that for haſt they burſt ſome of their big Guns, threw Waggons of Arms into the River, and left many of their Army that were ſick behind them. Some few of our Men went out, and brought in ſome Granadeers Priſoners, that were firing houſes at 6 or 7 Miles diſtance from the City. Others of them went to <hi>Inch,</hi> where Collonel <hi>Stewart</hi> having received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Ship all his Men and come off, had called a Council of his Officers, and by their Advice delay'd the Execution of them, till he had ſent to acquaint the Major General with the condition of the Proteſtants there, and ſhould receive his further Orders, as being loth to expoſe ſo conſiderable a Body of them as had come in to him to the mercileſs Fury of an enraged Enemy.</p>
            <p>And thus was the Siege of <hi>Derry</hi> raiſed, to the Admiration of our Friends, who had given us over for loſt, and to the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Enemies, who were no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident they ſhould ſoon make themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of ſo weak and indefenſible a Place. The Glory of it being entirely due to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who inſpir'd a Garriſon for the moſt part made up of a few raw and untrain'd Men, and thoſe labouring under all poſſible diſcouragements, with that Reſolution that enabled them to defeat all the Attempts of a numerous Army to reduce them. Their Zeal and Affection for the juſt Cauſe they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, ſupplying all the defects of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Diſcipline. So ſingular has been the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God to that City (as well as <hi>Innis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killing</hi>) in making it once more a Sanctuary to the diſtreſſed Proteſtants of the Province of <hi>Ulſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aug.</hi> 4. Capt. <hi>White,</hi> Capt. <hi>Dobbin,</hi> Capt. <hi>J. Hamilton,</hi> Capt. <hi>Jenny,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> were ſent to the Major General, who that day came to Town. Coll. <hi>Crofton</hi> had waited on him at <hi>Inch,</hi> and deſir'd leave to draw out 2 or 3 hundred Men, to go out into the County at large, to preſerve the Houſes of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants from being burnt, promiſing alſo to bring in a vaſt quantity of Cattle: but his Propoſal was rejected. And near a week af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſome ſmall Parties of <hi>Iriſh</hi> that ſtay'd behind burnt <hi>Newton Limavady,</hi> and ſeveral Gentlemens houſes in the County. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General put out ſeveral <hi>Proclamations,</hi> one, <hi>That all Perſons not in Arms, who had fled to that place, ſhould leave the City (the Country being now clear) and repair to their reſpective habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without taking any of their goods with them, unleſs they had a particular Order.</hi> Hereby the Bedding of many was detain'd from them. Another was, <hi>That no Perſon dying ſhould be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried within the Walls.</hi> Great Droves of the Country Peoples Cattle were brought near the Town, upon pretence of their belonging to the Enemy, and ſo few could recover their own again, that many Families were deprived thereby of the only conſiderable means of their ſubſiſtence. Coll. <hi>Mitchelburn</hi> was made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by the Major General, in whoſe hands the Cattle were left, who fold them according to the <hi>Major General</hi>'s Orders for good Rates to the Butchers and others.</p>
            <p>An Addreſs was prepar'd to be preſented to the King: And Coll. <hi>Walker</hi> was appointed by the the Major General to go with it. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that ſign'd it neither knew of the Bearer, nor were well pleas'd with the great Complement pafs'd on the Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in it, but were not willing at that time to make any diſturbance by any publick op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to it.</p>
            <p>The Men were all drawn out to the Field, and every Collonel's Regiment by it ſelf. The Soldiers went out the more chearfully, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was reported the Major General would that day diſtribute 2000 <abbr>

               <hi>Mitchelburn</hi>'s, and Collonel <hi>Crofton</hi>'s Regiments were joyned, and <hi>Croſton</hi> reduced. Collonel <hi>Walker</hi>'s and Collonel <hi>Hamil</hi>'s were joyned, <hi>Walker</hi> demitted, and <hi>Hamil</hi> reduced, Capt. <hi>White</hi> boing made Collonel to it, (who died <hi>September</hi> following.) Collonel <hi>Monro</hi>'s and Collonel <hi>Lance</hi>'s Regiment joyned, Collonel <hi>Monro</hi> reduc'd, <hi>Lance</hi> made Collonel, (who died <hi>September</hi> following.) Collonel <hi>Baker</hi>'s and Collonel <hi>Murray</hi>'s Regiment were deſigned to be joyned, but all of Collonel <hi>Murray</hi>'s (except a very few) refuſed, and went off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country with their Carrabines and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols, and the Major General ſeized their Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, as he alſo did Col. <hi>Murrays</hi> Horſe, which he had preſerv'd with great care during all the Siege. St. <hi>Johns</hi> was made Col. of <hi>Bakers</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: This being done, the Major General named new <hi>Captains</hi> to moſt of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, leaving them to chooſe their <hi>Lieutenants</hi> and <hi>Enſigns.</hi> So that a great many of thoſe <hi>Captains,</hi> who had not only rais'd and arm'd their Companies almoſt wholly at their own charge, but had done the greateſt Service in the Defence of the Town, were either <hi>disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> or <hi>reduced:</hi> And their Companies were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to others, that had neither expended any thing of their Fortunes, nor hazarded their Lives in that Cauſe. This was ill reſented in the Garriſon, but when one of theſe Captains took the Liberty to complain of it, inſtead of any Redreſs, he was (as himſelf inform'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of us) threatned with the new <hi>Gallows,</hi> which was ordered to be ſet up without the <hi>Ravelin.</hi> There were Orders alſo given to the Centries at the Gates, that none ſhould be ſuffered to go out with any Arms, and ſome that were walking out at the Gates had their Arms ſeized by the Guards plac'd there. This unexpected Treatment ſeemed very harſh and ſtrange to them, that they could not be truſted to bear thoſe Arms about them which they had ſo lately employed in the vigorous Defence of their Countrey. The weak and ſick Souldiers had nothing allowed them to ſubſiſt on out of the Stores, whereby they were forced to travel, and beg their Bread in the Countrey, which being extreamly depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated, many of them periſh'd for want. The Lieutenants and Enſigns far'd no better than the Captains, many of them being turn'd out, and others, who had at leaſt never been in the Siege, put in their Places. Nay, ſome that continued Captains, had Detachments of 15 Men taken out of their Companies, and put into the Regiments of ſuch as could not raiſe Men, and then the Captains were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be turn'd out if they made not up their Companies. Nay ſome of them were turn'd off, after they had been made uſe of to do that piece of Service for ſuch as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſucceed them. And even the new modell'd Regiments of <hi>Derry,</hi> that were receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Generals Army, had only the following ſubſiſtence.</p>

               <p>IN our ſad Calamity, and under the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Apprehenſions of our total exciſion by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in theſe parts of the Kingdom which border upon us, we thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us immediately to diſpatch <hi>David Cairns,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (a very worthy Citizen of this City, and lately a Member of this Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) into <hi>England,</hi> to report our Caſe to you, and to uſe his endeavours by all juſt means for our ſpeedy Relief. And we have eternal Obligations laid on us to bleſs God, whoſe Mercy and Providence reſcued us from the Deſigns of wicked Men, that conſpired our ruine, without any Provocation on our parts, whoſe Inclinations as well as Intereſt it was to live peaceably with all Men.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Fryday</hi> the 7th. Inſtant, ſeveral intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations came to ſeveral hands hereabout, that on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following a Maſſacre was deſigned by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in <hi>Ulſter;</hi> and although it cauſed great thoughts of Heart to the moſt aſſured amongſt us; yet none of the more aged and grave came to any other Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than to ſubmit to the Divine Providence, whatever the event might be: And juſt in that juncture, whilſt the younger and more inconſiderate were conſulting their own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (and it ſeems had reſolved on the means) a part of the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Regiment (newly levied, and all compoſed of <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> and <hi>Ulſter</hi> Papiſts) came to the River ſide, and their Officers came over into the City to the Sheriffs, for quarters and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for them: We confeſs our fears on the occaſion became more pungent, but we ſtill remained ſilent, except our Prayers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions. But juſt as the Soldiers were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the Gates, the Youthhood by a ſtrange impulſe ran in one Body and ſhut the Gates, and put themſelves in the beſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of defence they could. We blamed, but could not guide or perſwade them to any leſs Reſolution that night; and ſo the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers retired, and were quartered in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99417:29"/>Neighbourhood, where, although they did not murther or deſtroy any, yet many threats they uttered, and outrages they committed. The next day we hoped to prevail with thoſe that aſſumed the Power of the City, to open the Gates and receive the Garriſon; but the News and Intimations of the general Deſign came ſo faſt, ſo full from all quarters, that we then bleſſed God for our preſent eſcape, effected by means unforeſeen, and againſt our wills. In the general hurry and conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of not us only, but all the neighbouring Counties, when we have but ſcarce time to hear the repeated Informations of our Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it is not poſſible for us to furniſh the Bearer with all requiſite Teſtimonials to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this ſad truth; nor will it conſiſt with our ſafety to protract his ſtay 'till it can be done, the Veſſel that carries him being juſt ready for ſail. We muſt refer you to his Report, and Copies of Papers carryed over by him (ſign'd by us) for your further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in particulars; but do moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and heartily beſeech you, as you are Men of Bowels and Charity to aſſiſt this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman how beſt you can to ſecure us from the common Danger, and that we may peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably live obeying his Majeſty and the Laws, doing injury to no man, nor wiſhing it to any. Your Intereſt here is now no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worthy to engage you, the Lives of thouſands of Innocent Men, Women and Children are at ſtake. If you can, and will not now afford your help to the utmoſt, we ſhall never be able to uſe a Motive to induce you, or to prevail upon you.

               <p>
                  <hi>TO all Christian People to whom theſe Preſents ſhall come, the Mayors, Sheriffs and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the City of</hi> London-Derry <hi>ſend greeting. Having received Intimation from ſeveral Credible Perſons, That an Inſurrection of the</hi> Iriſh <hi>was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and by them a general Maſſacre of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in this Kingdom, and the ſame to be acted and perpetrated on or about the</hi> 9th. <hi>day of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> December. <hi>And being confirmed in our fear and jealouſie of ſo horrible a Deſign, by many pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Inſinuations, dubious Expreſſions, moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Letters, and poſitive Informations, all condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and concurring to beget in us a trembling Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a ſuddain and inevitable Ruine and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. We diſpoſed our ſelves to a patient and tame Reſignation to the Divine Providence, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hoping for ſome Deliverance and diverſion of this impending Miſery, or to receive from the hand of God ſuch meaſure of Constancy and Courage, as might enable us to poſſeſs our Souls in patience,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99417:30"/>and Submiſſively to wait the iſſue of ſo ſevere a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Accordingly, when on the ſeventh inſtant, part of the Earl of</hi> Antrims <hi>Forces advanced to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſion of this place, tho we looked on our ſelves as Sheep appointed for Slaughter, and on them as the Executioners of Vengance upon us; yet we contrived no other means of eſcape than by Flight, and with all Precipitation to hurry away our Families into other Places and Countries. But it pleaſed the Lord who watcheth over us, ſo to order things, that when they were ready to enter the City, a great Number of the younger, and ſome of the meaner ſort of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ran haſtily to the Gates and ſhut them, loudly denying Entrance to ſuch Gueſts, and obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing Obedience to us.

Wherefore we do Declare and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to the World, that as we have reſolved to ſtand upon our Guard, and Defend our Walls, and not to admit of any Papiſts whatſoever to Quarter among us: So we have firmly and ſincerely determined to perſevere in our Duty and Loyalty to our Soveraign Lord the King, without the leaſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrage of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, or Seditious Oppoſition to his Royal Commands.

And in as much as Union and Diſpatch are neceſſary for effecting the ſame: We the Nobility and Gentry of the County of <hi>Antrim</hi> do aſſociate together, firmly reſolving to adhere to the Laws of this Kingdom and the Proteſtant Religion, and to act in ſubordination to the Government of <hi>England,</hi> and the promoting of a free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

The Reaſons which induce us to put our ſelves in ſome neceſſary poſture of Defence, are ſo obvious and urgent upon us, when we conſider of the great Levies daily made of Popiſh Soldiers, and at this time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when the King is retired, and their Arming can in no wiſe be ſervicable to his Majeſties Intereſt: It were inconſiſtent with common Prudence, not to ſuſpect their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to be ſuch as will tend, if not to the Deſtruction, yet to the great endangering of the Lives, Liberties, and Properties of the Proteſtant Subjects of this Kingdom, if not prevented.

                  <hi>The Declaration of the Proteſtants of</hi> Sligo, <hi>January the</hi> 4th. 1688/9.</head>
               <p>WE the Proteſtants of the County of <hi>Sligo,</hi> at preſent Aſſembled for our common Safety, do hereby declare the Occaſions and Motives of this our Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and what is intended by it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We reſolve to adhere to the Laws of the Land, and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhall as we ought, Unite our ſelves accordingly with <hi>England,</hi> and hold to the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99417:31"/>lawful Government thereof, and to a free Parliament.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We declare, that our taking up Arms is only defenſive, and not in the leaſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Lives, Liberties, or Eſtates, of any of our fellow Subjects, whether Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks or others, while they demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in peaceable manner to us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our Reaſons for thus doing are ſo ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, that we could no longer with prudence forbear putting our ſelves in ſome neceſſary poſture of defence. For the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks Arming in ſuch vaſt numbers through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Kingdom, do give us juſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of ill deſigns in them; they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Kings Commiſſion for what they do, whereas we are aſſured that the King has commanded all Roman Catholicks to lay down their Arms, which we conceive ſhould as well extend to <hi>Ireland</hi> as <hi>England.</hi> And therefore we doubt, that the Leaders of this <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army do act from their own heads, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſigns of their own, which we may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear will be prejudicial to the Lives, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and Properties, of the Proteſtant Subjects of this Kingdom, if not prevented.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We declare, that as we will aſſault none that moleſt not us, ſo we will to our powers protect all from Violence, even Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks themſelves, whilſt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves peaceably and neighbourly amongſt us, (tho we will admit none, but Proteſtants into our Aſſociation,) until we be aſcertained from the lawful Authority and Government of <hi>England,</hi> what further Orders we are to obey. And we doubt not, but that all good Proteſtants in this Kingdom will, where they are able, joyn with us in the ſame publick Defence, and that God will bleſs this ſo juſt, innocent and neceſſary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, for our Lives, Laws, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>And whereas it will be neceſſary, for the more effectual and ſucceſsful carrying on of theſe our mutual endeavours, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Laws, Religion and Country, and the ſecurity of our Lives and Properties, and to avoid Confuſions and Diſtractions, which in ſuch caſes might otherwiſe happen, to appoint ſome Eminent Perſon or Perſons to whoſe Conduct we may intirely ſubmit our ſelves in this our undertaking:</p>
               <p>We do therefore by theſe Preſents unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly Nominate, Elect and appoint the Right Honourable <hi>Robert</hi> Lord Baron of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> and the Honourable <hi>Chidley Coot,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And do hereby oblige our ſelves to ſerve under his or their Command, in ſuch manner, and in ſuch place and Station, as they or one of them, in their diſcretion and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall direct.</p>
               <p>And that we will procure ſuch Horſe and Foot, and ſuch a number of Men, Arms, and Ammunition, as we or any of us can poſſibly provide; and that with all Expedition, immediately to be arrayed and formed into Troops and Companies, and to be diſpoſed of from time to time according to their, or either of their Orders.
